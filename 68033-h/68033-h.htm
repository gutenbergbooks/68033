<p>’Tis not in my nature to be cowed by any
woman whatever. Therefore, when I found
myself in the presence of my Lady Hawkshaw,
in her Chinese drawing-room, with her great
black eyes glaring at me, and her huge black
plume of feathers nodding at me, as she sat,
enveloped in a vast black velvet robe like a
pall, I said to myself, “After all, she is but a
woman.” So I stared back at her with all the
coolness in the world&mdash;and I was a seeker after
favor, too&mdash;and but fourteen years of age,
and had only seven and sixpence in my pocket.
The tall footman who stood behind Lady Hawkshaw’s
chair made a grimace at me; and I responded
by a fierce look, as if I were about to
run him through the body.</p>

<p>“Jeames,” said her ladyship, “go and make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>my compliments to Sir Peter Hawkshaw, and
say to him that his roistering kept me awake
half the night, and consequently I feel very ill
this morning; and that his great-nephew, Master
Richard Glyn from America, is come after a
midshipman’s warrant in his Majesty’s navy,&mdash;and
I desire Sir Peter to attend me in my <i>bowdwor</i>
immediately.”</p>

<p>Her ladyship’s French was the queerest imaginable,&mdash;yet
in her youth she had the French
tutor who had taught the daughters of the
Regent of France.</p>

<p>There was a silence after the tall footman
left, during which my lady and I eyed each
other closely. I remembered having heard that
she had defied her father, Lord Bosanquet, and
one of the greatest family connections in the
kingdom, in order to marry Sir Peter, who was
then a penniless lieutenant in his Majesty’s
navy and the son of a drysalter in the city.
This same drysalter was my great-grandfather;
but I had an infusion of another blood through
my mother, God bless her!&mdash;who was of a high
family and a baronet’s daughter. The drysalter
strain was honest, but plebeian, while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>the baronet strain was rather more lofty than
honest, I fancy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo1"><img src="images/i_002.jpg" width="400" alt="Here is your nephew Tom’s brat" /></a></div></div>

<p class="caption no-indent">“Here is your nephew Tom’s brat.” <i>Page <a href="#Page_3">3</a></i></p>

<p>Having heard, as I say, of the desperate
struggle it cost Lady Hawkshaw to marry her
lieutenant, I somewhat expected to find her and
Admiral Sir Peter Hawkshaw living like doves
in a cage, and was disconcerted at the message
her ladyship sent her lord. But I was still more
disconcerted when Sir Peter, a short, stout man,
with a choleric eye, presently bounced into the
room.</p>

<p>“Sir Peter,” said her ladyship, “here is your
nephew Tom’s brat, who wants a midshipman’s
warrant.”</p>

<p>Sir Peter stopped short, looked me over,&mdash;I
was tall for my age,&mdash;and grinned savagely.
I thought it was all up with me and was almost
ready to haul down my flag.</p>

<p>“And Sir Peter,” screamed her ladyship, “he
must have it!”</p>

<p>“Hang me, my lady!” snapped Sir Peter,
“but when did you take such an interest in my
nephew Tom’s brat?”</p>

<p>“This very hour,” replied Lady Hawkshaw
tartly, and tossing her black plumes haughtily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
“You behaved like a wretch to the boy after
the death of his father and mother in America;
and God has given you the chance to make
amends, and I say he shall have his warrant.”</p>

<p>“Zounds, Madam!” bawled Sir Peter; “since
you take the liberty of disposing of my warrants,
I presume you are the holder of my
commission as Vice-Admiral of the White in
his Majesty’s service. Let me know it if you
are&mdash;let me know it, I say!”</p>

<p>“Stuff!” responded my lady, to which Sir
Peter answered something that sounded like
“Damme!” and then my attention was distracted
from this matrimonial engagement by
the silent entrance of two young girls. One
of them was about twelve years of age. She
had dove-like eyes, and her dark lashes kissed
her cheek. She came and stood familiarly by
Lady Hawkshaw’s chair; and the gentle affectionateness
of her manner toward that redoubtable
person amazed me at the time. This was
my first sight of Daphne Carmichael; and
when she fixed her soft, childish glance upon
me, it was like the sight of stars on a cloudy
night. But the other one, a tall girl of sixteen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>or thereabouts, dazzled me so that I am obliged
to confess I had no more eyes for Daphne.
This older girl was the Lady Arabella Stormont,
and was then and always by far the
handsomest creature I ever beheld. I shall not
attempt to describe her. I will only say that
her brilliant face, with such a complexion as
I never saw before or since, showed a haughty
indifference toward the shabby boy over whom
Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw were squabbling,
and the sense of my shabbiness and helplessness
pierced my heart under Lady Arabella’s calmly
scornful gaze.</p>

<p>Both of these young girls were the great-nieces
of Sir Peter Hawkshaw, but not on the
drysalter’s side, so they were no blood-relation
to me. Sir Peter was their guardian, and Lady
Hawkshaw had charge of them, and was most
kind and devoted to them in her way. I
soon found out that every one of Sir Peter’s
family had a good friend in Lady Hawkshaw;
and I may as well say here that for true
devotion and incessant wrangling, I never saw
a married pair that equaled Sir Peter and Lady
Hawkshaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>The discussion between them concerning me
grew hotter, and I grew as hot as the discussion,
in thinking what a figure I was making
before that divinely beautiful Lady Arabella.
I had clean forgotten Daphne. Lady Hawkshaw
lugged in a great variety of extraneous
matter, reminding Sir Peter of certain awful
predictions concerning his future which had
been made by the last chaplain who sailed with
him. Sir Peter denounced the chaplain as a
sniveling dog. Lady Hawkshaw indulged in
some French, at which Lady Arabella laughed
behind her hand.</p>

<p>The battle royal lasted some time longer, but
Lady Hawkshaw’s metal was plainly heavier
than Sir Peter’s; and it ended by Sir Peter’s
saying to me angrily:</p>

<p>“Very well, sir, to oblige my lady I will give
you the remaining midshipman’s berth on the
<i>Ajax</i>, seventy-four. You may go home now,
but show yourself aboard the <i>Ajax</i> at Portsmouth,
before twelve o’clock on this day week,
and be very careful to mind your eye.”</p>

<p>I had nerved myself to hear with coolness
the refusal of this fiery admiral; but his real
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>kindness, disguised under so much of choler,
overcame me. I stammered something and
stopped,&mdash;that hound of a footman was grinning
at me, because my eyes were full of tears,
and also, perhaps, because my coat was of
cheap make, and my shoes needed attention.
But at that moment little Daphne, with the
greatest artlessness, came up and slipped her
little hand into mine, saying:</p>

<p>“He means he is very much obliged to you,
uncle, and to you, dear aunt.”</p>

<p>I do not know how I got out of the house,
but the next thing I knew I was standing on
the street outside. I had been told to go home.
I had no home now unless the Bull-in-the-Bush
tavern be one. But I did not return to the
Bull-in-the-Bush, whose tawdry splendors revolted
me now, after I had seen Sir Peter
Hawkshaw’s imposing house, as much as they
had before attracted me. I was tingling with
the sense of beauty newly developed in me. I
could not forget that exquisite vision of Lady
Arabella Stormont, who seemed to my boyish
mind more like a white rose-bush in full flower
than anything I could call to memory. I made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>my way instead to the plain, though clean lodgings,
where I had spent the years since my parents’
death, with good Betty Green, the widow of
Corporal Green, late of my father’s regiment.</p>

<p>These two excellent but humble creatures
had brought me, an orphan, home from my
birthplace, America, consigned to Sir Peter and
Lady Hawkshaw. This woman, Betty Green,
had been my mother’s devoted servant, as her
husband had been my father’s, and it was
thought perfectly safe to send me home with
them. But there was a danger which no one
foresaw. Betty was one of those strange
women who love like a lioness. This lioness’
love she felt for me; and for that reason, I
believe, she deliberately planned to prevent my
family from ever getting hold of me. It is
true, on landing in England, her husband’s
regiment being ordered to Winchester, she went
to see Sir Peter Hawkshaw and, I suspect, purposely
made him so angry that, Lady Hawkshaw
being absent, he almost kicked Betty Green
out of the house. That is what I fancy my
lady meant when she reproached Sir Peter with
cruelty to me. I well remember the air of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>triumph with which Betty returned and told
the corporal of her ill success; then, clasping
me in her arms, she burst out with a cry that
no admiral nor ladies nor lords neither should
take her darling boy away from her. Green,
her husband, being a steady, cool-headed fellow,
waited until the paroxysm was over, when he
told her plainly that she must carry out my
parents’ instructions, and he himself would go
to see Sir Peter as soon as he could. But
Fate disposed of this plan by cutting short the
corporal’s life the next week, most unexpectedly.
Then this woman, Betty Green,&mdash;illiterate, a
stranger in England, and supporting us both
by her daily labor,&mdash;managed to foil all of
the efforts of Admiral Sir Peter Hawkshaw to
find me; for he had done all he could to discover
the whereabouts of his nephew’s orphan. ’Tis
not for me to say one word against Betty Green,
for she slaved for me as only a woman can slave,
and, besides, brought me up in the habits and
manners of a gentleman, albeit she did little
for my education, and to this day I am prone
to be embarrassed when I have a pen in my
hand. I can not say that I was happy in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>devoted, though savage love she lavished upon
me. She would not allow me to play with the
boys of her own class, and those of my class I
never saw. All my clamorings to know something
about my family on either side were met
by her declaring that she had forgotten where
my mother’s people lived; and as for Sir Peter,
she gave me such a horrifying account of him
that I never dreamed it possible to receive any
kindness from him. At last, though, on her
death-bed, she acknowledged a part of the deception
her desperate affection had impelled her
to play upon me. The poor soul had actually
forgotten about my mother’s family, and had
destroyed everything relating to them, but directed
me to go to Sir Peter; and thus it was
that, on the day after I saw Betty Green, my
only friend on earth, laid in a pauper’s grave,
I went to the house of my father’s uncle, with
the result narrated. When I got back to the
humble lodgings where I had lived before
Betty’s death, I looked up a small box of
trinkets of little value which had belonged to
my mother, and from the sale of them I got
enough to live upon for a week, and to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>my way to Portsmouth at the end of it. Either
Sir Peter had forgotten to tell me anything
about my outfit, or else I had slipped out so
quickly&mdash;galled by the fear of weeping before
that rascally footman&mdash;that he had no chance.
At all events, I arrived at Portsmouth by the
mail-coach, with all of my belongings in one
shabby portmanteau.</p>

<p>I shall not describe my feelings during that
journey toward the new life that awaited me.
In fact, I scarcely recall them coherently; all
was a maze, a jumble, and an uproar in my
mind.</p>

<p>We got down in the inn yard,&mdash;a coach full
of passengers,&mdash;I the only one who seemed
adrift and alone among them. I stood looking
about me&mdash;at a pert chambermaid who impudently
ogled the hostlers and got a kiss in return;
at the pretentious entrance to the inn; at
all of the bustle and confusion of the arrival
of the coach. Presently I saw a young gentleman
somewhat older than myself, and wearing
the uniform of his Majesty’s sea-service, come
out of the inn door. He had a very elegant
figure, but his face was rather plain. Within
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>five minutes of my first meeting with Giles
Vernon, I had an example of what was one of
his most striking traits&mdash;every woman in sight
immediately fixed her attention on him and
smiled at him. One was the chambermaid, who
left off ogling the hostlers and gaped at this
young officer with her coarse, handsome face
all aflame; another was the landlady, who followed
him to the door, smirking and fanning
herself; and the third was a venerable Quakeress,
who was about entering the inn, and who
beamed benevolently on him as he bowed gallantly
in passing. I know not why this should
have made such an impression on me; but being
young and a fool, I thought beauty was as
highly prized by women as by men, and it
surprised me that a fellow with a mouth so wide
and with something dangerously near a squint
should be such a lady-killer. It was common
enough for young gentlemen holding midshipmen’s
warrants to come down by the coach, and
as soon as he saw me this young officer called
out:</p>

<p>“Halloo, my hearty! Is it a ship of the line
or a frigate you are booked for? Or is it one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>of those damned gun-brigs which are unfit for
a gentleman to serve in?”</p>

<p>Now, the peculiar circumstances of my bringing-up
had given me a ridiculous haughtiness,&mdash;for
Betty Green had never ceased to implore
me to remember my quality,&mdash;so I replied to
this offhand speech in kind.</p>

<p>“A ship of the line,” said I. “Damme, do
you think I’d serve in a gun-brig?”</p>

<p>He came up a little closer to me, looked at
me attentively, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“It’s an infant Rodney, sure. Was not
Americus Vespucius your grandfather? And
was not your grandmother in love with Noah
when he was oakum boy at the Portsmouth
docks?”</p>

<p>I considered this very offensive and, drawing
myself up, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“My grandfather was a baronet, and my
grand-uncle is Admiral Sir Peter Hawkshaw,
whose flagship, as you may know, is the <i>Ajax</i>,
seventy-four.”</p>

<p>“I know him well,” responded my new acquaintance.
“We were drunk together this
night week. He bears for arms Lot’s wife
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>after she was turned into a pillar of salt, with
the device, ‘I thirst’.”</p>

<p>This was an allusion to the drysalter. For
I soon found that the young gentlemen in the
cockpit were intimately acquainted with all of
the antecedents, glorious or otherwise, of their
superior officers.</p>

<p>The lie in the early part of this sentence was
patent to me, but so great was the power to
charm of this squinting, wide-mouthed fellow,
that I felt myself drawn to him irresistibly, and
something in my countenance showed it, for
he linked his arm through mine and began
again,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I know your great-aunt, too, Polly Hawkshaw.
Dreadful old girl. I hear she can tack
ship as well as the admiral; knows to a shilling
what his mess bill is, and teaches him
trigonometry when he is on leave.”</p>

<p>This was, of course, a vilification, and Lady
Hawkshaw’s name was not Polly, but Apollonia;
but I blush to say I spoke not one word
in defense of either her or her name. It occurred
to me that my new friend was a person
who could give me much information about my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>outfit and uniforms, and I candidly stated my
case to him.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he cried. “There’s a rascal of
a haberdasher here who lives off his Majesty’s
officers, and I’ll take you there and fit you out;
for Sir Peter’s the man to have his young
officers smart. A friend of mine&mdash;poor fellow!&mdash;happened
to be caught in mufti in the
<i>Ajax</i> the other day, and Sir Peter had all hands
turned up for an execution. My unhappy
friend begged that he might be shot instead of
hanged, and Sir Peter, I’ll admit, granted him
the favor. The poor fellow tied the handkerchief
over his eyes himself, forgave all his
enemies, and asked his friends to pay his debts.
Zounds, ’twas the most affecting scene I ever
witnessed.”</p>

<p>I plainly perceived that my companion was
talking to frighten me, and showed it by
thrusting my tongue into my cheek, which
caused him to burst out laughing. He presently
became grave, however, and assured me
solemnly that a sea-officer had his choice of
dressing handsomely, or being court-martialed
and shot. “For,” said he, “the one hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>and forty-fourth regulation of the service
reads, ‘All of his Majesty’s sea-officers are commanded
to marry heiresses, and in these cases,
the usual penalties for the abduction of heiresses
are remitted’. Now, how can we abduct heiresses,
or even get them to look at us, without
fine clothes? Women, my boy, are caught by
the eye alone&mdash;and I know ’em, by Gad!”</p>

<p>This trifling speech remained in my memory,
and the day came when I recalled the idle talk
of us two laughing midshipmen as prophetic.</p>

<p>We went together to a shop, where, under
his direction and that of an oily-tongued shopman,
I ordered one of the handsomest outfits
any midshipman could possibly have, including
two dozen of silk stockings, as my new-found
friend informed me that every man on board
his Majesty’s ships, from the admiral down to
the jack-o’-the-dust, always wore silk stockings,
because in the event of being struck by a ball
or a pike or a cutlass in action, the danger from
inflammation was much less with silk than with
cotton or wool.</p>

<p>All went swimmingly, until it was time to
pay for the things. Then, I acknowledge, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>was at a loss. The shopman, suddenly changing
his tone, cried out to my companion,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Giles Vernon, I remember the last
reefer you brought here bought near a boatload
and paid with the foresail, as you gentlemen
of the sea call it. I will not be done this
time, I assure you.”</p>

<p>At this, Giles Vernon promptly drew his
sword, which did not disturb the shopman in
the least, as I found out afterward; young
gentlemen of Giles’ age and rank, in Portsmouth,
drew their swords whenever they could
not draw their purses. But I was very unhappy,
not on Giles’ account, but on that of
the poor shopman, whom I expected to see
weltering in his blood. After a wordy war,
Giles left the shop, taking me with him, and
menacing the shopman, in case the purchases I
had ordered did not come aboard the <i>Ajax</i> that
night.</p>

<p>I thought it wise to suggest that I should
now go aboard, as it was well on to three
o’clock. Giles agreed with me. I had forgotten
to ask him what ship he was attached
to, but it suddenly occurred to me that he, too,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>might be in the <i>Ajax</i>, and I asked him. Imagine
my delight when he said yes.</p>

<p>“But if the admiral does not behave himself
better,” he added, “and if the captain does
not ask me to dinner oftener than he has been
doing lately, I shall prefer charges against both
of them. I have been assured by the lords in
admiralty that any request of mine will be regarded
as an order by them, and I shall request
that Admiral Hawkshaw and Captain Guilford
be relieved of their commands.”</p>

<p>By that time we had reached the water and
there, stepping into a splendid, eight-oared
barge, I saw Sir Peter Hawkshaw. He caught
sight of us at the same moment, and the change
in Giles Vernon’s manner was what might have
been expected. He was even more modest and
deferential than I, as we advanced.</p>

<p>“Here you are!” pleasantly cried the admiral
to me. “You ran away so fast t’other
day, that I had no chance to give you any
directions, and I scarcely expected you to turn
up to-day. However, I shall now take you to
the ship. Mr. Vernon, I have room for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” responded Giles very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>gratefully, “but I have a pressing engagement
on shore&mdash;a matter of important business&mdash;”
at which I saw the suspicion of a grin on the
admiral’s homely old face. He said little to
me until we were in the great cabin of the
<i>Ajax</i>. For myself, I can only say that I was
so awed by the beauty, the majesty, the splendor
of one of the finest ships of the line in the
world, that I was dumb with delight and
amazement. Once in the cabin, the admiral
asked me about my means and my outfit. I
burst out with the whole story of what occurred
in the haberdasher’s shop, at which Sir
Peter looked very solemn, and lectured me upon
the recklessness of my conduct in ordering
things with no money to pay for them, and
followed it up with an offer to fit me out
handsomely. This I accepted with the utmost
gratitude, and in a day or two I found myself
established as one of his Majesty’s midshipmen
in the cockpit of the <i>Ajax</i>, and I began to
see life.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2></div>

<p>My introduction into the cockpit of the <i>Ajax</i>
was pretty much that of every other reefer in
his Majesty’s navy. I was, of course, told that
I showed the most brazen presumption in daring
to wish to enter the naval service; that I ought
to be a choir boy at St. Paul’s; that haymaking
was my profession by nature, to say nothing of
an exchange of black eyes and bloody noses with
every midshipman of my size in the cockpit.
Through all this Giles Vernon was my chief
tormentor and best friend. He proclaimed
the fact of my drysalting ancestry, and when
I imprudently reminded him that I was the
grandson of a baronet, he gave me one kick
for the drysalter and two for the baronet. He
showed me a battered old cocked hat hung up
on a nail in the steerage country.</p>

<p>“Do you see that hat, you young rapscallion?”
he asked.</p>

<p>I replied that I did, and a shocking bad hat
it was, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“That hat was once the property of that
old pirate and buccaneer, Sir Peter Hawkshaw,
Vice-Admiral of the White. It is named after
him, and whenever his conduct displeases the
junior officers on this ship,&mdash;which it generally
does,&mdash;that hat, dear boy, is kicked and cursed
as a proxy for your respected great-uncle.
Now understand: your position in the cockpit
is that of this hat. In fact, you will take the
hat’s place,”&mdash;which I found to be true, and I
was called to account every day for some part
of the conduct of Admiral Hawkshaw, although
I did not see him twice in the week.</p>

<p>Mr. Buxton, our first lieutenant, was a fine
officer, and celebrated for licking midshipmen
into shape; and if I learned my duty quickly,
he, rather than I, deserves the credit.</p>

<p>My experience of other ships convinces me
that the juniors in the <i>Ajax</i> were clever fellows;
but Giles Vernon was undoubtedly the
smartest officer among them and cock of the
walk between decks. He had innumerable good
qualities, but the beggarly virtue of prudence
was not among them. He had, however, another
virtue in a high degree,&mdash;a daring and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>invincible courage. That, and his smartness as
an officer, made Mr. Buxton his friend, and
caused many of his peccadilloes to be overlooked.</p>

<p>The fact that at nineteen Giles Vernon was
still only a midshipman made me think that he
was without fortune or influence; but I was
soon enlightened on the subject, though not by
him. He was the distant cousin and heir of
Sir Thomas Vernon of Vernon Court, near York,
and of Grosvenor Square, London. This man
was generally spoken of as the wicked Sir
Thomas, and a mortal hatred subsisted between
him and his heir. Giles had been caught trying
to induce the money sharks to take his post-obits;
but as Sir Thomas was not yet fifty years
of age, and it was quite possible that he should
marry, the only result was to fan the flame of
animosity between him and his heir, without
Giles’ getting a shilling. The next heir to Giles
was another cousin, remote from both him and
Sir Thomas, one Captain Philip Overton of the
Guards, who was as much disliked by Sir
Thomas as was Giles. Giles, who had been at
sea since his twelfth year, knew little or nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>of Captain Overton, although he swore many
times in a month that he meant to marry the
first woman who would take him, for the purpose
of cutting off Overton’s hopes; but it occurred
to me, young as I was, that Giles was not the
man to give up his liberty to the first woman
who was willing to accept of it.</p>

<p>We were fitting for the Mediterranean, and
the ship lay in the inner harbor at Portsmouth,
waiting her turn to go in dry dock to be coppered.
There was plenty for the seniors to do,
but not much for the midshipmen at that particular
time; and we had more runs on shore
than usual. The rest of us were satisfied with
Portsmouth, but Giles was always raving of
London and the London playhouses.</p>

<p>Knowing how long I had lived in London, he
said to me one day,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Were you ever at Drury Lane Theater, my
lad?”</p>

<p>I said no, I had never been to the playhouse;
and I blushed as I said it, not desiring my
messmates to know that I had been brought up
by Betty Green, a corporal’s widow.</p>

<p>“Then, child,” he cried, whacking me on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>back, “you have yet to live. Have you not seen
Mistress Trenchard&mdash;the divine Sylvia&mdash;as
<i>Roxana</i>, as <i>Lady Percy</i>, as <i>Violetta</i>? Oh, what
a galaxy of parts! Oh, the divine creature!”</p>

<p>He threw himself across the mess-table at
that, for we were in the cockpit at the time. I
laughed, boylike, at his raptures, and he groaned
loudly.</p>

<p>“Such a face and figure! Such a foot and
ankle! Such a melting eye! Such a luscious
voice!”</p>

<p>I own that this outburst did more to make
me realize that Giles, after all, was but nineteen
than anything that had gone before; for I
knew that older men did not so rave.</p>

<p>“And,” he cried wildly, “I can not see her
before we sail. By Heaven, I <i>will</i> see her!
’Tis seventy-four miles between me and her
angel face. It can be done in seven hours and
twenty minutes. I can get twenty-four hours’
leave&mdash;but not a word of this, you haymaking
son of a farmer.”</p>

<p>No sooner had Giles said this than with the
determination to be known as a man of spirit
(I was, as I said, but fourteen), I concluded I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>would go to London, too. On the day that
Giles Vernon got his twenty-four hours’ leave,
I also got the same. Mr. Buxton looked a
little queer when I asked him for it, and said
something about not allowing the midshipmen
to leave Portsmouth; but I answered readily
enough that I wished very much to go on a
little expedition with Giles Vernon, which would
last overnight. As the other midshipmen had
been allowed similar liberty, I got my request;
and next morning, as the Phœbus coach for
London rolled out of the stables into the inner
yard, I appeared. Giles Vernon was also on
hand. His surprise was great when he saw me.</p>

<p>“You take a risk, my lad,” he said.</p>

<p>“No more than you do,” I replied stoutly.
“And I, too, love a roguish eye and a blushing
cheek, and mean to go to the playhouse with
you to see Mistress Trenchard.” At which
Giles roared out one of his rich laughs, and
cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Come along then, my infant Don Juan.”</p>

<p>We got inside the coach, because it was far
from unlikely that we might meet some of our
own officers on the road, or even Sir Peter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>Hawkshaw himself, who traveled much between
Portsmouth and the Admiralty. And had we
been caught, there is little doubt that we should
have been forced to right about face, in spite
of the leave each one of us had in his pocket.
So we made ourselves extremely small in a
corner of the coach, and only ventured to peep
out once, when we caught sight of Sir Peter
Hawkshaw’s traveling chaise going Londonwards,
and Sir Peter himself lying back in it,
reading a newspaper. After that, you may be
sure we were very circumspect.</p>

<p>I noticed, however, the same thing in the
coach that I had observed the first hour I set
eyes on Giles Vernon&mdash;that every woman he
met was his friend. There were some tradesmen’s
wives, a French hairdresser, and the
usual assortment of women to be found in a
public coach; and in half an hour Giles Vernon
had said a pleasant word to every one of them,
and basked in their smiles.</p>

<p>The day was in April, and was bright
throughout; and the relays of horses were so
excellent that we reached London at four in the
afternoon, having left Portsmouth at nine in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>the morning. We went straight to a chop-house,
for we were ravenously hungry.</p>

<p>“And now, Dicky boy,” said Giles to me,
“keep a bright lookout for any of our men;
and if you see one, cut your cable and run for
it, and if we are separated, meet me at the
White Horse Cellar at twelve o’clock to-night
to take the midnight coach.”</p>

<p>By the time we had got our dinner, it was
time to go to the play. We marched off, and
made our way through the mob of footmen, and
got seats for the pit: and when we went in,
and I saw the playhouse lighted up and the
boxes filled with beautiful creatures, I was near
beside myself. Giles laughed at me, but that
I did not mind.</p>

<p>I gaped about me until suddenly Giles
gripped my arm, and whispered to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t look to the left. There is a box with
Peter Hawkshaw in it, and Polly, and two girls&mdash;one
of them the greatest beauty I ever saw,
though but a slip of a girl. If Peter or Polly
sees us, Lord help us!”</p>

<p>I did not look around immediately, but the
desire to have a glimpse of the adorable Lady
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>Arabella made me steal a glance that way.
She was very beautifully dressed, and though
but little more than sixteen, such a vision of
loveliness as fairly to rival reigning beauties of
several seasons’ standing. I own that I saw
little Daphne sitting by Lady Arabella, but I
noted her scarcely at all.</p>

<p>Nor could Giles keep his eyes off Lady Arabella;
and I noticed that even when the divine
Sylvia, as he called her, was on the stage, he
was not strictly attentive to her, but rather
sought that fateful box where so much beauty
was enthroned.</p>

<p>The divine Sylvia was a delightful actress, I
must admit, and in spite of being forty if she
was a day, and though raddled with paint, she
had something winning in her air and face, and
I could understand her tremendous popularity
with the young bloods.</p>

<p>Neither Sir Peter nor Polly, as Giles called
her, showed any signs whatever of having recognized
us in the large crowd in the pit, and we
began to congratulate ourselves heartily. There
was a seat next to us held by a gentleman’s
servant, and presently he gave way to a remarkably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
handsome young man of six or seven
and twenty.</p>

<p>A few words passed between master and man,
and then we knew that the handsome gentleman
was Captain Philip Overton, of the Second Life
Guards. Giles exchanged significant looks with
me.</p>

<p>Captain Overton seated himself quietly, and,
after a careless glance at the house, seemed to
retire into his own thoughts, quite unmindful of
the stage and what was going on upon it. I
wondered why a man who seemed so little in
harmony with his surroundings should take the
trouble to come to the play.</p>

<p>But if Captain Overton were indifferent to
all about him, one person, the young beauty in
Lady Hawkshaw’s box, was far from indifferent
to him. Lady Arabella saw his entrance, and
from that moment she was occupied in trying
to obtain his attention. When at last he recognized
her and bowed slightly, she flamed all
over with color, and gave him as good an invitation
as any man might want to come to her
box. But Overton made no sign of any intention
to go to her, and, when she finally seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>to realize this, she became as indifferent to all
about her as he was. Other persons came to
the box and went during the play, but they
got little heed from Lady Arabella. Little
Daphne, although but a child, not yet in her
teens, showed a lively interest in all that
passed and behaved in a most young-ladyish
way, much to my diversion. (I was all of two
years older than she.)</p>

<p>As the play progressed, I saw that Giles was
becoming more and more infatuated with the
fledgling beauty, and he even whispered to me a
suggestion that we present ourselves boldly at
the door of the box. This I received with horror,
fearing both Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw.
Indeed, I had not been able to shake
off this fear of my great-uncle and aunt for a
moment.</p>

<p>One’s first night at the play is usually a
magic dream, but mine was tempered with the
dread of being caught on the spot, of being
delayed in our return to Portsmouth, and the
torment of seeing the adored of my heart quite
absorbed in another man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption no-indent">There was nothing for me to do but to walk along beside him.  <i>Page <a href="#Page_31">31</a></i></p>

<p>When the play was over, we sat still until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>the Hawkshaw party had passed out, and then,
more for the sake of bravado, I think, than
inclination, Giles ran pell-mell to the stage
door, where he made one of a mob of gentlemen
to see the divine Sylvia to her chair. And, to
my alarm, as soon as the lady was within and
the curtain drawn, he tipped the wink to one
of the chairmen, who silently gave up his place,
and Giles, taking up the pole, trudged off,
assisting to carry his portly mistress. There
was nothing for me to do but to walk along
beside him amid the rattle and roar of coaches,
the shouting of the hackney coachmen, the
pushing and jostling of chairmen and linkboys,
and all the confusion that attends the emptying
of a London playhouse. Mrs. Trenchard’s
door was not far away, and when she was put
down, and Giles sneaked off, I observed the
handsome Captain Overton standing at the turn
of the street laughing at him. Giles, who was
so timid in his love, was bold enough in his
wrath, and stepping up to Overton said coolly:</p>

<p>“Sir, I perceive you are smiling. Who is
the harlequin that amuses you, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“You, sir,” promptly answered Overton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“You are too good,” responded Giles, “and I
have before pinked my man in beauty’s quarrel,”&mdash;and
then he slapped Overton in the mouth.
The next thing I knew their two swords were
flashing in the moonlight. I stood paralyzed
with fear. Not so a couple of burly watchmen,
who, running forward, clutched the offenders
and dragged them apart.</p>

<p>But the two late enemies, making common
cause against the watchmen, fought them off;
and when the watchmen desisted from the fight
to spring their rattles for assistance, both Giles
and the officer ran down a dark alley, followed
by me as fast as my short legs would carry me,
and soon all three of us were huddled together
in the porch of a church, some distance away
from the scene of the fracas.</p>

<p>“Neatly done,” remarked Overton with a
smile, to Giles. “I should have been in that
brawny fellow’s clutches now, but for the clip
over the head you gave him.”</p>

<p>“You did your share, sir,” politely responded
Giles.</p>

<p>“But time presses and our affairs must be
settled,” said Overton; “here is my card. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>is too dark to read it, but I am Captain Philip
Overton, of the Second Life Guards.”</p>

<p>“And I,” replied Giles, “am Midshipman
Giles Vernon, of the <i>Ajax</i>, ship of the line, now
at Portsmouth.”</p>

<p>By the dim light of a lantern in the church
porch, I saw the expression of astonishment
upon Overton’s face.</p>

<p>“Then,” he stammered, “we are related.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Giles, smiling, “and if you
pierce me through with sword or pistol, it will
be worth one of the finest estates in the kingdom
to you, provided always that old villain,
Sir Thomas Vernon, does not marry and have
children to spite us.”</p>

<p>Overton reflected, half laughing and half
frowning.</p>

<p>“If only you had not passed a blow! Anything
else, there could be an accommodation
for. It was most unfortunate.”</p>

<p>“Yes, as it turns out,” responded Giles;
“but the question is, now, when and where can
we meet?”</p>

<p>Just then the great bell of St. Paul’s tolled
out the half-hour before midnight, and I, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>had been an almost unobserved listener, spoke,
out of the fullness of my heart.</p>

<p>“Giles,” said I, “the coach leaves at twelve.
If we do not get to Portsmouth in time, we
are deserters. Let Captain Overton write to
you and fight afterward.”</p>

<p>“Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
comes wisdom,” replied Overton, smiling; and
so in two minutes it was settled, Overton agreeing
to come to Portsmouth to fight, if Giles
could not get leave to meet him half-way between
Portsmouth and London. We then bade
him good-by, and ran off as fast as our legs
could carry us, and barely made the coach.</p>

<p>We traveled all night, Giles sleeping soundly
and snoring very loud, in one corner. I felt
great uneasiness about the coming meeting
between him and Overton, although I believed
there was no hostile feeling between them.
But when two men face each other with arms
in their hands, there is always the possibility
of awful catastrophe.</p>

<p>The roseate morning broke when we were
still some distance from Portsmouth. The sight
of the blooming hedge-rows, the bird-songs, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>all the fair beauty of the morning made me long
to be outside, and at the last stage&mdash;my companion
still sleeping&mdash;I got out, and with a
shilling to the coachman, got the box seat.
There were only two or three persons, besides
the guard, on the coach.</p>

<p>Once up there, I could not rest satisfied without
handling the ribbons. I had never even
driven a donkey in my life, but, nevertheless,
I aspired to drive four fresh roadsters. The
coachman, a good-natured, foolish fellow, gave
me the reins, down a perfectly smooth lane.
I seized the whip, too, and brought it down
across the wheelers’ backs, and, the next thing
I knew, the coach was lying on its side on the
road, and I was on the ground.</p>

<p>It was over in a wink, and it seemed scarcely
longer before it had been righted; for the load
was extremely light, and no one was hurt
except Giles. He scrambled out of the coach
window, his arm hanging down, not broken, but
out of joint. I pointed to it.</p>

<p>“Your sword arm,” I said.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to make for
Portsmouth as fast as possible. Giles was in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>extreme pain; he said nothing, but great drops
came out upon his forehead. When we reached
the town, I at once put off in search of a surgeon,
while Giles remained at the inn. I
soon fetched the surgeon, who got the arm into
place. When the man had finished, Giles asked
when he could use his arm for pistol shooting.</p>

<p>“In a week, perhaps; possibly not for two
weeks.” And the surgeon departed.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of the room, Giles
sent for pen and paper, and with the most
painful effort, guiding his right hand by his
left, managed to indite the following epistle to
Captain Overton:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>“This is to inform you that I met with a
most unfortnit axerdent while coming down on
the coach. My friend and messmate, the infant
admiral which you saw with me, had read the
story of Gehu in the Bible or Homar, I forget
which, and aspired to drive four horses. Which
he did, with the result that my right arm was
rentched out of place, and the rascally doctor
who sett it says I cannot use it for some days.
This is most unfortnit, as it delays the pleasure

<span class="right5">“Mid. on H. M. S. <i>Ajax</i>.”</span></p></div>

<p>Giles gave me this to read, and I pointed out
several mistakes he had made in spelling, although
the tone of the letter was gentlemanlike,
as everything was that Giles did. With great
vexation and some difficulty, he added a postscript.</p>

<p>“P. S.&mdash;Please excuse speling as my arm is
very paneful.      G. V.”</p>

<p>At that moment a marine from the <i>Ajax</i>
bounced, breathless and in great excitement, into
the room.</p>

<p>“We are to sail with the tide, to-night, sir!”
he said. “The admiral passed the messenger
on the road; the jib is loose, and the blue peter
flying,”&mdash;and out he ran, to notify the other
absentees.</p>

<p>Giles seized the paper, and added laboriously:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“P. S. No 2.&mdash;I am just informed that the
Blue Peter is flying from the <i>Ajax</i>, and that,
my dear sir, signifies that we are about to sail.
Our meeting must be postponed, for god knose
when we will eat fresh butter again. <i>But you
shall hear from me.</i>      G. V.”</p>

<p>And that night we sailed with the tide.</p>

<p>We were ordered to join Sir John Jervis’
fleet in the Mediterranean without the loss of
a day, and, when the tide served at nine o’clock
that night, Sir Peter Hawkshaw was ready for
it. The officers, who knew Sir Peter’s capacity
for picking up his anchors at short notice, were
generally prepared, and were but little surprised
at the sudden departure of the ship. The men,
however, are never prepared to go, and the ship
was besieged, from the time she showed the blue
peter until she set her topsails, by the usual
crowd of bumboat women, sailors’ wives, tavern-keepers,
shop-dealers, and all the people with
whom Jack trades, and who are loath to part
with him for reasons of love or money. Although
all of the stores were on board, there
were market supplies to get, and the midshipmen
were in the boats constantly until the last
boat was hoisted in, just as the music called the
men to the capstan bars. It was a brilliant
moonlight night, a good breeze was blowing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>and the <i>Ajax</i> got under way with an unusual
spread of sail. As we passed out the narrow
entrance into the roads, the wind freshened and
the great ship took her majestic way through
the fleet, a mountain of canvas showing from
rail to truck. The first few days I was overcome,
as it were, with my new life and its
duties. Two other midshipmen, junior to myself,
had joined, so I was no longer the exclusive
butt of the cockpit. We spent most of our
spare time expressing the greatest longing for
a meeting with the French, although for my
own part, even while I was bragging the most,
I felt a sickness at the heart when I imagined a
round shot entering my vitals. Giles Vernon
was still the dearest object of my admiration
and affections&mdash;always excepting that divinely
beautiful Lady Arabella. But this was rather
the admiration of a glowworm for a star. I
had no one else to love except Giles, and even
a midshipman must love something.</p>

<p>I did not much trouble myself about that
meeting, so far in the future, between Giles
and Overton. Youth has no future, as it has
no past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>Naturally, I did not see much of my great-uncle,
the admiral. He was a very strict disciplinarian,
probably because he was used to
discipline at home, and busied himself more with
the conduct of the ship than the captain liked.
The other midshipmen alleged that there was
no love lost between Captain Guilford and the
admiral, and the captain had been heard to
say that having an admiral on board was like
having a mother-in-law in the house. Nevertheless,
Sir Peter was a fine seaman, and the
gun-room joke was that he knew how to command,
from having learned how to obey under
Lady Hawkshaw’s iron rule.</p>

<p>One day the admiral’s steward brought me
a message. The admiral’s compliments, and
would I dine in the great cabin at five o’clock
that day?</p>

<p>I was frightened out of a year’s growth by
the invitation, but of course I responded that
I should be most happy. This, like my professed
anxiety to meet the French, was a great
lie. At five o’clock I presented myself, trembling
in every limb. The first thing I noted in
the cabin was a large portrait of Lady Hawkshaw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
as a young woman. She must have been
very handsome.</p>

<p>Sir Peter gave me two fingers, and turning
to the steward, said, “Soup.”</p>

<p>Soup was brought. We were mostly out of
fresh vegetables then, and it was pea-soup, such
as we had in the cockpit. Sir Peter grumbled
a little at it, and it was soon removed and a
leg of pork brought on; a pig had been killed
that day.</p>

<p>“Aha!” sniffed Sir Peter delightedly.
“This is fine. Nephew, you have no pig in
the gun-room to-day.”</p>

<p>Which was true; and Sir Peter helped me
liberally, and proceeded to do the same by
himself. The steward, however, said respectfully,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Sir Peter, but in the interview
I had the honor to have with Lady Hawkshaw
before sailing, sir, she particularly desired me to
request you not to eat pork, as it always disagreed
with you.”</p>

<p>“Wh-wh-what!” roared Sir Peter.</p>

<p>“I am only repeating Lady Hawkshaw’s message,
sir,” humbly responded the man; but I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>thought I saw, under all his humility, a sly
kind of defiance. Sir Peter had no fear of
either round, grape, or double-headed shot, and
was indifferent to musketry fire. Likewise, it
was commonly said of him in the service that
if he were ordered to attack hell itself, he would
stand on until his jib caught fire; but neither
time nor distance weakened the authority over
him of Lady Hawkshaw.</p>

<p>Sir Peter glared at the steward and then at
the leg of pork, and, suddenly jumping up,
seized the dish and threw it, pork and all, out of
the stern window. As I had secured my portion,
I could view this with equanimity.</p>

<p>The next dish was spareribs. The steward
said nothing, but Sir Peter let it pass with a
groan. It seemed to me that everything appetizing
in the dinner was passed by Sir Peter,
in response to a peculiar kind of warning glance
from the steward. This man, I heard afterward,
had sailed with him many years, and was
understood to be an emissary of Lady Hawkshaw’s.</p>

<p>We had, besides the pea-soup and roast pork,
spareribs, potatoes, turnips, anchovy with sauce,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>and a custard. Sir Peter, however, dined off
pea-soup and potatoes; but I observed that he
was his own master as far as the decanters were
concerned, and it occurred to me that he had
made a trade with the steward, by which he
was allowed this indulgence, as I noticed the
man turned his back every time Sir Peter filled
his glass.</p>

<p>Dinner being over, the cloth removed, and
the steward gone, Sir Peter appeared to be in
a somewhat better humor. His first remark
was,&mdash;</p>

<p>“So you are fond of the play, sir?”</p>

<p>I replied that I had been but once.</p>

<p>“The time you went with Giles Vernon. If
the coach had broken down between London and
Portsmouth, we should have sailed without
either one of you.”</p>

<p>I did not mention that the coach had upset,
but merely said that we thought there was no
danger of any detention, and that Giles Vernon
was in no way responsible for my going to
London, as he knew nothing about it until we
met at the coach door.</p>

<p class="caption no-indent">He turned his back every time Sir Peter filled his glass.  <i>Page <a href="#Page_44">44</a></i></p>

<p>I was revolving in my mind whether I could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>venture to ask of the welfare of the divine Arabella,
and suddenly a direct inspiration came to
me. I remarked&mdash;with blushes and tremors, I
must admit,&mdash;</p>

<p>“How very like Lady Arabella Stormont
must Lady Hawkshaw have been at her age!
And Lady Arabella is a very beautiful young
lady.”</p>

<p>Sir Peter grinned like a rat-trap at this
awkward compliment, and remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Arabella is like my lady, except
not half so handsome. Egad, when I married
Lady Hawkshaw, I had to cut my way, literally
with my sword, through the body-guard of
gentlemen who wanted her. And as for her
relations&mdash;well, she defied ’em, that’s all.”</p>

<p>I tried, with all the little art I possessed, to
get some information concerning Arabella out
of Sir Peter; but beyond telling me what I
knew before,&mdash;that she was his great-niece on
the other side of the house and first cousin to
Daphne, and that her father, now dead, was a
scamp and a pauper, in spite of being an earl,&mdash;he
told me nothing. But even that seemed
to show the great gulf between us. Would she,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>with her beauty and her title, condescend to a
midshipman somewhat younger than herself,
and penniless? I doubted it, though I was, in
general, of a sanguine nature.</p>

<p>I found Sir Peter unbent as the decanters
grew empty, although I would not for a moment
imply that he was excessive in his drinking.
Only, the mellow glow which pervades an
English gentleman after a few glasses of good
port enveloped him. He asked me if I was
glad I had joined the service,&mdash;to which I could
say yes with great sincerity; impressed upon me
my good fortune in getting in a ship of the line
in the beginning, and gave me some admirable
advice. I left him with a feeling that I had a
friend in that excellent seaman, honest gentleman,
and odd fish, Admiral Sir Peter Hawkshaw.</p>

<p>When I went below, I told my messmates
all that had occurred, rather exaggerating Sir
Peter’s attentions to me, as midshipmen will.
Then privately I confided to Giles Vernon. I
told what little I had found out concerning the
star of my soul, as I called Arabella, to which
Giles responded by a long-drawn-out “Ph-ew!”</p>

<p>I implored him, if he knew any officer in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>ship who would be likely to be acquainted with
Lady Arabella, to pump him for me. This he
promised; and the very next day, as I sat on a
locker, studying my theorems, Giles came up.</p>

<p>“Dicky,” said he, “Mr. Buxton knows the
divine Arabella. She has a fortune of thirty
thousand pounds, and so has the dove-eyed little
Daphne, all inherited from their granddad, a
rich Bombay merchant. It seems that Lady
Arabella’s mother bought a coronet with her
money, and it turned out a poor bargain.
However, the earl did not live long enough to
ruin his father-in-law; and little Daphne’s parents,
too, died young, so the old Bombay man
left the girls his fortune, and made Sir Peter
their guardian, and that means, of course, that
Polly Hawkshaw is their guardian. Mr. Buxton
says he would like to see the fortune-hunter
who can rob Polly of those two damsels. For
Polly says rank and lineage are not everything.
She herself, you know, dates back to the Saxon
Heptarchy, though she did marry the son of
your drysalting great-grandfather. And she
wants those girls to marry <i>men</i>; and what Polly
says on that score is to be respected, considering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>that she married into a drysalting family to
please herself, or to displease her relations, I
don’t know which. I should say, though, if
you are honest and deserving, and mind your
book, and get a good word from the chaplain,
you will probably one day be the husband of
little Daphne, but not of Lady Arabella; no
man shall marry her while I live, that you may
be sure of; but when I marry her, you may be
side-boy at my wedding.”</p>

<p>I thought this speech very cruel of Giles
Vernon, and believed that he did not know what
true love was, else he could not so trifle with
my feelings, although there was an echo of
earnestness in his intimation that he would kill
any man who aspired to marry Lady Arabella.</p>

<p>We were three weeks in the Bay of Biscay,
thrashing to windward under topgallant-sails,
and expecting daily and hourly to run across a
Frenchman. We were hoping for it, because
we found the <i>Ajax</i> to be a very weatherly
ship and fast for her class; and both Captain
Guilford and Sir Peter, who had sailed in her
before, knew exactly how to handle her. And
we were to have our wish. For, one evening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>toward sunset, we sighted a French ship of the
line off our beam; and by the time we had made
her out, a light French frigate was coming
down the wind, and in an hour we were at it
hammer and tongs with both of them.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen thought they had us. We
heard afterward that a prize crew was already
told off to take us into Corunna, but no man or
boy on the <i>Ajax</i> dreamed of giving up the ship.</p>

<p>The <i>Ajax</i> was cleared for action in eleven
minutes; and, with four ensigns flying, we
headed for the ship of the line, which was waiting
for us, with her topsails shivering. The
<i>Ajax</i> had been lately coppered, and, with all
sail to royals set, legged it at a lively gait, in
spite of the heavy sea, which occasionally caused
our lower-deck guns to roll their noses in the
water. As we wallowed toward the ship of the
line, which was the <i>Indomptable</i>, the frigate,
the <i>Xantippe</i>, was manœuvering for a position
on our starboard quarter to rake us. Seeing
this, the <i>Ajax</i> came up a little into the wind,
which brought our broadside to bear directly on
the <i>Xantippe</i>, and she hedged off a little.</p>

<p>The steadiness, coolness, and precision with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>which the ship was handled astonished my young
mind. I knew very well that if we were defeated,
Sir Peter Hawkshaw would stand no
show of leniency, for there was no doubt that,
owing to our new copper, we could easily have
outsailed the Frenchmen; but Sir Peter preferred
to outfight them, even against desperate
odds.</p>

<p>The officers and men had entire confidence in
Sir Peter and in the ship, and went into action
with the heartiest good-will imaginable. The
people were amused by two powder monkeys
coming to blows in the magazine passage over
which one would be entitled to the larger share
of prize-money. The gaiety of the men was
contagious. Every man’s face wore a grin; and
when the word was given to take in the royals,
and send down the yards, furl all staysails and
the flying jib, they literally rushed into the
rigging with an “Aye, aye, sir,” that seemed
to shake the deck.</p>

<p>The admiral, who had been on the bridge,
left it and went below. Presently he came up.
He was in his best uniform, with a gold-hilted
sword, his order of the Bath on his breast, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>he wore a cocked hat. As he passed me, Mr.
Buxton, who was stepping along briskly, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Sir Peter, but a French musket
wants no better target than a cocked hat.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” replied Sir Peter, “I have always
fought in a cocked hat and silk stockings, as
becomes a gentleman; and I shall always fight
in a cocked hat and silk stockings, damme!”</p>

<p>Mr. Buxton passed on, laughing.</p>

<p>Now, I had taken the opportunity, after we
had sighted the Frenchman, to run below and
put on my newest uniform, with silk stockings,
and to get out several cambric pocket handkerchiefs;
and I had also scented myself liberally
with some attar of rose, which I had bought in
Portsmouth. Sir Peter, putting his fingers to
his nose, sniffed the attar of rose, and, speedily
identifying me, he surveyed me calmly all over,
while I blushed and found myself unable to
stand still under his searching gaze. When he
spoke, however, it was in words of praise.</p>

<p>“Nephew, you have the right idea. It is a
holiday when we meet the enemy, and officers
should dress accordingly.”</p>

<p>Mr. Buxton, who was standing near, sneaked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>off a little. He had on an old coat, such as I
had never seen him wear, and had removed his
stock and tied a red silk handkerchief around
his neck. He certainly did not look quite the
gentleman. The <i>Indomptable</i>, being then about
half a mile distant, bore up and fired a shot to
windward, which was an invitation to come on
and take a licking or give one. The <i>Ajax</i> was
not misled into the rashness of coming on, with
the <i>Xantippe</i> hanging on her quarter, but, luffing
up suddenly,&mdash;for she answered her helm
beautifully,&mdash;she brought the frigate directly
under her guns; and that fetched the <i>Indomptable</i>
as fast as she could trot. The <i>Ajax</i>
opened the ball with one of her long twenty-fours,
Sir Peter himself sighting and pointing
the gun; and immediately after the whole
broadside roared out. Had it struck the frigate
full, it would have sent her to the bottom;
but by hauling quickly by the wind, she only
received about half the discharge. That, however,
was terrible. Her mizzenmast was cut off,
and hung over her side in a mass of torn rigging;
her mainmast was wounded; and it was
plain that our broadside had killed and wounded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>many men, and had dismounted several guns.
Her wheel, however, was uninjured, and in an
inconceivably short time the wreck of the mast
had been cut away; and wearing, with the wind
in her favor, she got into a raking position on
our port quarter, and gave us a broadside that
raked us from stern to stem.</p>

<p>The savage which dwells in man had made me
perfectly indifferent to the loss of life on the
French ship; but when a man dropped dead at
my side, I fell into a passion of rage, and, I
must honestly admit, of fear. My station was
amidships, and I recalled, with a dreadful sinking
of the heart, that it was commonly known
as the slaughter-house, from the execution generally
done there.</p>

<p>I looked down and saw the man’s blood soaking
into the sand, with which the deck was
plentifully strewed, and I, Richard Glyn, longed
to desert my station and run below. But as I
turned, I caught sight of Giles Vernon, a little
distance away from me. He was smiling and
waving his hat, and he cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>“See, boys! the big ’un is coming to take her
punishment! Huzza!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Indomptable</i> had then approached to
within a quarter of a mile, and as a heavy
sea was kicked up by the wind, and all three
of the ships were rolling extremely, she luffed
up to deliver her broadside; and at that moment
three thundering cheers broke from the nine
hundred throats on the <i>Ajax</i>, and they were instantly
answered by a cheer as great from the
Frenchman. Owing to the sharp roll, most of
the French shot went a little too high, just
above the heads of the marines, who were drawn
up in the waist of the ship. My paroxysm of
fear still held me, but when I saw these men,
with the one proud word “Gibraltar” written
on their hats, standing steadily, as if at parade,
in the midst of the hurricane of fire, the men
as cool as their officers, shame seized me for
my cowardice; from that on, I gradually mastered
my alarms. I here mention a strange
thing; as long as I was a coward at heart, I
was also a villain; for if one single shot could
have sent the Frenchman’s body to the sea and
his soul to hell, I would have fired that shot.
But when I was released from the nightmare
of fear, a feeling of mercy stole into my soul.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>I began to feel for our brave enemy and to wish
that we might capture him with as little loss as
possible.</p>

<p>The cannonade now increased; but the wind,
which is usually deadened, continued to rise,
and both the heavy ships were almost rolling
their yard-arms in the water. The <i>Indomptable’s</i>
fire was exceedingly steady, but not well
directed, while, after ten minutes of a close fire,
it was seen that we were fast shooting her spars
out of her. The frigate, much disabled by the
loss of her mast, had fallen off to leeward, and
never got close enough again to be of any assistance
to her consort.</p>

<p>The <i>Ajax’s</i> people began to clamor to get
alongside, and alongside we got. As we neared
the <i>Indomptable</i>, occasionally yawing to prevent
being raked, his metal began to tell, and we
were much cut up aloft, besides having been
hulled repeatedly; but we came on steadily.
The man at the wheel had nearly all his clothes
torn off him by a splinter, but with the spirit of
a true seaman, he stood at his post unflinchingly,
never letting go of the spokes for one moment.
When we were within a couple of pistol-shot, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>Frenchman opened a smart musketry fire. Sir
Peter had left the bridge for a moment and was
crossing the deck, when a ball went through his
hat, knocking it off and tearing it to pieces.
He stooped down, picked it up, and then called
out to a powder boy who was passing.</p>

<p>“Go to my cabin, and in the upper drawer
of the locker to the left of my bed-place, you
will see two cocked hats; bring me the newest
one. Hanged if I’ll not wear a decent hat, in
spite of the Frenchman!”</p>

<p>And this man was ruled by his wife!</p>

<p>We hove to about a cable’s length from the
Frenchman, and then the fight began in earnest.
We were so near that every shot told.
The Frenchman made great play with his main-deck
battery, and our sails and rigging soon
were so cut up, that when we came foul, a few
minutes later, we were jammed fast; but nobody
on either ship wished it otherwise. The Frenchman’s
main-yard swung directly over our poop,
and Captain Guilford himself made it fast to
our mizzen rigging. The Frenchman, however,
was not yet beaten at the guns, and the firing
was so heavy on both sides that a pall of smoke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>enveloped both ships. This was to our advantage,
for the frigate, having got some sail on
the stump of her mizzenmast, now approached;
but the wind drifted the smoke so between her
and the two fighting ships, that she could not in
the dim twilight plainly discern friend from foe,
especially as both were painted black, and we
swung together with the sea and wind. When
the smoke drifted off, the gallant but unfortunate
<i>Xantippe</i> found herself directly under our
broadside. We gave her one round from our
main battery, and she troubled us no more.</p>

<p>Of my own feelings, I can only say that I
welcomed the return of my courage so rapturously,
I felt capable of heroic things. Occasionally
I recognized Sir Peter as he flitted
past; he seemed everywhere at once, and I perceived
that although Captain Guilford was technically
fighting the ship, Sir Peter was by no
means an idle spectator. My gun was on the
engaged side all the time, and several of the
guns on that side became disabled, and officers
were wounded or killed; it brought Giles Vernon
quite close to me. Through the smoke and
the fast-falling darkness, lighted only by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>red flash of the guns and the glare of the battle
lanterns, I could see his face. He never lost his
smile, and his ringing voice always led the
cheering.</p>

<p>Presently, the Frenchman’s fire slackened,
and then a dull, rumbling sound was heard in
the depths of the <i>Indomptable</i>, followed by a
roar and streams of light from the fore-hatch.
The forward magazine had exploded, and it
seemed in the awful crash and blaze as if all
the masts and spars went skyward, with the
rags of the sails, and a solemn hush and silence
followed the explosion.</p>

<p>In another instant I heard Sir Peter’s sharp
voice shouting,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Call all hands to board! Boatswain, cheer
the men up with the pipe!”</p>

<p>And then the clear notes of the boatswain’s
pipe floated out into the darkness, and with a
yell the men gathered at the bulwarks. On the
French ship they appeared to be dazed by the
explosion, and we could see only a few officers
running about and trying to collect the men.</p>

<p>In another instant I saw Mr. Buxton leap
upon the hammock-netting, and about to spring,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>when a figure behind him seized him by the coattails,
and, dragging him backward, he measured
his length on the deck. The figure was
Giles Vernon.</p>

<p>“After me,” he cried to the first lieutenant;
and the next moment he made his spring, and
landed, the first man on the <i>Indomptable’s</i> deck.</p>

<p>As soon as the ship was given up, we hauled
up our courses and ran off a little, rove new
braces, and made ready to capture the frigate,
which, although badly cut up, showed no disposition
to surrender, and stood gallantly by her
consort. In half an hour we were ready to go
into action again, if necessary, with another
ship of the line.</p>

<p>We got within range,&mdash;the sea had gone
down much,&mdash;and giving the <i>Xantippe</i> our
broadside, brought down the tricolor which the
Frenchmen had nailed to the stump of the mizzenmast.
She proved to have on board near a
million sterling, which, with the <i>Indomptable</i>,
was the richest prize taken in for years preceding.</p>

<p>The admiral and captain got eleven thousand
pounds sterling each. The senior officers received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
two thousand five hundred pounds sterling
each. The juniors got two thousand
pounds sterling, the midshipmen and petty
officers one thousand five hundred pounds sterling,
and every seaman got seven hundred
pounds sterling, and the landsmen and boys
four hundred pounds sterling in prize-money.
And I say it with diffidence, we got much more
in glory; for the two French ships were not only
beaten, but beaten in the most seamanlike manner.
Sir Peter ever after kept the anniversary
as his day of glory, putting on the same uniform
and cocked hat he had worn, and going to
church, if on shore, with Lady Hawkshaw on
his arm, and giving thanks in a loud voice.</p>

<p>We took the <i>Xantippe</i> home&mdash;the <i>Indomptable</i>
went to the bottom of the Bay of Biscay&mdash;but
before our prize-money was settled up,
we were off again; Sir Peter dearly loved cruising
in blue water. It was near two years before
we got back to England to spend that prize-money;
for, except the captain and Mr. Buxton
and some of the married officers, I know of no
one who saved any. Sir Peter, I understood
afterward, spent much of his in a diamond necklace
and tiara for Lady Hawkshaw, in which he
was most egregiously cheated by a Portuguese
money-lender, and the balance he put into a
scheme for acclimating elephants in England,
which was to make him as rich as Crœsus; but
he lost a thousand pounds on the venture, besides
his prize-money. In those two years I
grew more and more fond of Giles Vernon. We
generally contrived to have our watch together,
and we were intimate as only shipmates could
be. He talked much of what he meant to do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>when he got ashore with money to spend, and
assured me he had never had above twenty
pounds of his own in his life. In the course of
many nights spent in standing watch together,
when the old <i>Ajax</i> was sailing like a witch,&mdash;for
she was a capital sailer at that time,&mdash;he
told me much about his early youth, and I confided
to him the story of Betty Green. Giles’
career had been the common one of the younger
branches of a good family. His father had
been a clergyman, and, dying, left several
daughters, who married respectably, and this
one son, who was put in the sea-service very
young. At that time, several lives stood between
Giles and the title and estates of Sir
Thomas Vernon, and other lives stood between
Giles and Overton; but those had passed away,
leaving these two distant kinsmen as heirs to a
man that seemed rightfully to have earned his
title of “wicked Sir Thomas.” I asked Giles
if he knew why Sir Thomas, who so cordially
hated his heirs, had never married. Giles replied
that Sir Thomas showed no inclination to
marry until he was near forty. Then his reputation
was so well established that he was generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
looked askant upon; his character for
truth was bad and at cards was worse. But he
had induced a lady of rank and wealth to become
engaged to be married to him. His treatment
of her was so infamous that her whole
family had declared war against him, and had
succeeded in breaking off several very desirable
alliances he would have liked to make. Of
course a man of his rank and wealth could find
some woman&mdash;alas!&mdash;to take him; but Sir
Thomas was bent on money, with an inclination
toward rank, and was the last man on earth to
marry unless he had a substantial inducement;
and several more years had passed without his
being able to effect the sort of marriage he desired.
Meanwhile, his health had broken down,
and he was now a shattered man and prey for
the doctors. All this was very interesting to
me, especially as Sir Thomas’ two heirs would
one day have the experience of shooting at each
other, and possibly deciding the matter of
heirship by the elimination of one or the other
from the question.</p>

<p>We both got promotion, of course, and that
brought us into the gun-room; but we were as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>intimate there as in our reefer days in the cockpit.
On a glorious October morning in 1799,
our anchor kissed the ground in Portsmouth
harbor.</p>

<p>When we reached Portsmouth, the news of
our good fortune had preceded us, and we were
welcomed with open arms by men, women, and
children&mdash;especially the women. All the
prize-money brought back by any single ship
during the war was insignificant compared with
ours. The men were seized with a kind of
madness for spending their money. The spectacle
of an ordinary seaman parading the streets
of Portsmouth with a gold-laced hat, a gold-headed
stick, and watches and jewelry hung
all over him was common enough, and he was
sure to be an <i>Ajax</i> man. Sad to say, the pimps,
and the worst class of men and women soon got
the money away from our poor fellows.</p>

<p>The officers, in their way, were but little behind
the men in their lavishness. Champagne
was their common drink, and several of them
invested in coaches!&mdash;the last thing they would
ever have a chance of using.</p>

<p>Giles Vernon, although the most wasteful and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>profuse man I ever saw, desired to spend his
money in London, Portsmouth being too small
a theater for him. But the pressing affair of
the satisfaction he owed Captain Overton had to
be settled. After much hard thinking, Giles
came to me on the day after we reached Portsmouth,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dicky boy, read this letter and give me
your opinion of it.”</p>

<p>This was the letter,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right no-indent">
“H.M.S. <i>Ajax</i>, May 17, 1799.</p>

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="smcap">Captain Philip Overton</span>:</p>

<p>“<i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;This is to inform you that I
have reached Portsmouth, after a very successful
cruise in the <i>Ajax</i>, when we took the <i>Indomptable</i>
and the <i>Xantippe</i> and a large sum
in specie. My shair is considerable&mdash;more
money in short than I ever saw, much less handled,
in my life. I would like a month in London
to spend this money before offering my
carkass to be made full of holes by you. Dear
sir, consider. If I escape your marksmanship,
the month more or less will be of little account;
and if I fall, I shall miss the finest chance of
seeing the world I ever had in my life. I think,
sir, with difidence I say it, that my record in the
<i>Ajax</i> is enough to make plain I am not shurking
the satisfaction I owe you, but I would take
it as a personal favor if you would put it off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>to this day month, when I will be in London.
And as I shall eat and drink of the best, ’tis ten
to one I will be much fater and therefore be a
much better mark for you. I am, dear sir,</p>

<p><span class="right2">“Your obliged and</span><br />
<span class="right3">“Obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="right4">“<span class="smcap">Giles Vernon</span>.”</span></p></div>

<p>I pointed out to Giles that, although the tone
of the letter was quite correct, the writing and
spelling were scarce up to standard&mdash;I was
more bookish than Giles. But he replied with
some heat,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Who, while reading the communication of a
gentleman, will be so base as to sneer at the
grammar or spelling?” So the letter went as it
was, and in reply came a very handsome, well-expressed
letter from Captain Overton, not only
agreeing to postpone it a month, but for six
weeks, which pleased Giles mightily. I wish to
say, although Giles was inexpert with the pen,
he had no lack of either polish or ideas, and was
as fine an officer as ever walked the deck.</p>

<p>The matter with Overton finally settled, and
the ship being paid off, Giles and I started for
London, as happy as two youngsters could be,
with liberty and two thousand pounds apiece to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>spend, for I acknowledge that I had no more
thought of saving than Giles. We took a chaise
and four to London&mdash;no stage-coach for us!&mdash;and
reached there in a day. We had
planned to take the finest rooms at Mivart’s
Hotel, but fate and Lady Hawkshaw prevented
me from enjoying them except for the first
night of our arrival. Next morning on presenting
myself at the Admiralty to ask for
letters,&mdash;never dreaming I should have any,&mdash;I
received one from Sir Peter Hawkshaw, which
read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Grand-nephew.</span>&mdash;My Lady Hawkshaw
desires that you will come and bring your
money with you to our house in Berkeley
Square, and remain there.</p>

<p><span class="right2">“Yours, etc.,</span><br />
<span class="right3">“<span class="smcap">P. Hawkshaw</span>, C.B.”</span></p></div>

<p>Great was my distress when I got this letter,
as I foresaw there would not be much chance
under Lady Hawkshaw’s eagle eye of seeing the
kind of life I wished to see. And I was obliged
to go, for Sir Peter was the only person on
earth likely to interest himself at the Admiralty
for me; and I might stay and wither on shore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>while others more fortunate got ships, if I antagonized
him. And when Lady Hawkshaw
commanded, there was but one thing to do, and
that was to obey.</p>

<p>So, with a heavy heart, I took myself and my
portmanteau and, in a canvas bag, my two thousand
guineas to the admiral’s great fine house in
Berkeley Square. My parting with Giles was
melancholy enough; for, with the womanish
jealousy of a boy, I was unhappy to think he
would be enjoying himself with some one else,
while I was suffering the hardship of having
my money taken care of for me.</p>

<p>Giles had no more forgotten the Lady Arabella
than I had, and, on reading this note, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Zounds! I wish Peter and Polly had sent
for me to stay in Berkeley Square, with that
divine creature under the same roof. Do you
think, Dicky, we could exchange identities, so
to speak?” But on my reminding him that
Lady Hawkshaw had demanded my prize-money,
and would certainly get it, his ardor
to stand in my shoes somewhat abated.</p>

<p class="caption no-indent">With her were Daphne and the glorious Lady Arabella.  <i>Page <a href="#Page_69">69</a></i></p>

<p>When I reached Sir Peter’s house about noon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>the same tall and insolent footman that I had
seen on my first visit opened the door for me.
Lady Hawkshaw, wearing the same black velvet
gown and the identical feathers, received me,
and sitting with her were Daphne Carmichael
and the glorious, the beautiful, the enchanting
Lady Arabella Stormont.</p>

<p>If I had fallen madly in love with her when
I was but fourteen, and had only seven and sixpence,
one may imagine where I found myself
when I was near seventeen, and had two thousand
pounds in a bag in my hands. Lady
Hawkshaw’s greeting was stiff, but far from unkind;
and she introduced me to the young ladies,
who curtsied most beautifully to me, and, I may
say, looked at me not unkindly.</p>

<p>“Is that your prize-money in that bag, Richard?”
asked Lady Hawkshaw immediately.</p>

<p>I replied it was.</p>

<p>“Jeames,” she said, “go and make my compliments
to Sir Peter, and say to him that if he
has nothing better to do, I would be glad to see
him at once. And order the coach.”</p>

<p>Jeames departed.</p>

<p>I sat in adoring silence, oblivious of Daphne,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>but gazing at Lady Arabella until she exclaimed
pettishly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“La! Have I got a cross-eye or a crooked
nose, Mr. Richard, that you can’t take your
eyes off me?”</p>

<p>“You have neither,” I replied gallantly.
“And my name is not Mr. Richard, but Mr.
Glyn, at your ladyship’s service.”</p>

<p>“Arabella,” said Lady Hawkshaw in a voice
of thunder, “be more particular in your address
to young gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, ma’am!” pertly replied Lady Arabella.
“But such <i>very</i> young gentlemen, like
Mr. Glyn, or Mr. Thin, or whatever his name
may be, are always difficult to please in the way
of address. If you are familiar, they are affronted;
and if you are reserved, they think
you are making game of them.”</p>

<p>By this speech I discovered that although
Lady Hawkshaw might rule her world, terrorize
Sir Peter, and make the Lords of the Admiralty
her humble servitors, she had one rebel in the
camp, and that was Lady Arabella Stormont.
I saw that her remarks displeased Lady Hawkshaw,
but she endured them in silence. Who,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>though, would not endure anything from that
cherub mouth and those dazzling eyes?</p>

<p>Sir Peter now appeared and greeted me.</p>

<p>“Sir Peter,” said Lady Hawkshaw in her
usual authoritative manner, “you will go in the
coach with me to the bank, with Richard Glyn,
to deposit his money. You will be ready in ten
minutes, when the coach will be at the door.”</p>

<p>“I will go with you, Madam,” replied Sir
Peter; “but I shall order my horse, and ride
a-horseback, because I do not like riding in that
damned stuffy coach. And besides, when you
and your feathers get in, there is no room for
me.”</p>

<p>“You ride a-horseback!” sniffed Lady
Hawkshaw. “Even the grooms and stable boys
laugh at you. You are always talking some
sea nonsense about keeping the horse’s head to
the wind, and yawing and luffing and bowsing
at the bowline, and what not; and besides, I am
afraid to trust you since Brown Jane threw you
in the Park.”</p>

<p>It ended by Sir Peter’s going in the coach,
where the little man lay back in the corner,
nearly smothered by Lady Hawkshaw’s voluminous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
robe, and pishing and pshawing the whole
way.</p>

<p>But I was quite happy,&mdash;albeit I was the
victim of Lady Hawkshaw in having my money
kept for me,&mdash;for on the seat beside me was
Lady Arabella, who chose to go with us. She
made much game of me, but I had the spirit
to answer her back. After placing the money,
we took an airing in the park, and then returned
to dinner at five o’clock. I neither knew
nor cared what became of Daphne; for was I
not with the adored Lady Arabella?</p>

<p>That night Lady Hawkshaw was at home,
and I had my first experience of a London rout.
The card-tables were set on the lower floor, for
although Lady Hawkshaw hated cards, yet it
was commonly said that no one could entertain
company in London without them.</p>

<p>And that night I made a strange and terrible
discovery. Lady Arabella was a gamester of
the most desperate character, in ready money,
as far as her allowance as a minor permitted,
and in promises to pay, when she came into her
fortune, as far as such promises would be accepted.
But they were not much favored by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>the gentlemen and ladies who played with her;
for the chances of her marrying before her majority
were so great, that her I O U’s were not
considered of much value, and found few takers,
even when accompanied by Lady Arabella’s
most brilliant smiles; for your true gamester is
impervious to smiles or frowns, insensible to
beauty&mdash;in short, all his faculties are concentrated
on the odd trick.</p>

<p>A great mob of fine people came and there
was a supper, and many wax lights, and all the
accessories of a fashionable rout. I wandered
about, knowing no one, but observant of all. I
noticed that a very clever device was hit upon by
Lady Arabella and others who liked high play,
which Lady Hawkshaw disliked very much.
The stakes were nominally very small, but in
reality they were very large, shillings actually
signifying pounds. All of the people who
practised this were in one of the lower rooms,
while Sir Peter, who was allowed to play six-penny
whist, and those who in good faith observed
Lady Hawkshaw’s wishes, were in a room
to themselves. I must not forget to mention,
among the notable things at this rout, Lady
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>Hawkshaw’s turban. It was a construction of
feathers, flowers, beads, and every other species
of ornament, the whole capped with the celebrated
tiara which had been bought from the
Portuguese, and the diamond necklace beamed
upon her black velvet bosom. Sir Peter seemed
quite enchanted with her appearance, as she
loomed a head taller than any woman in the
rooms, and evidently considered her a combination
of Venus and Minerva&mdash;not that the pair
ceased squabbling on that account. I think
they disagreed violently on every detail of the
party, and Sir Peter was routed at every point.</p>

<p>Among those who did not play was Daphne,
then quite as tall as I and well on into her sixteenth
year. I could not but acknowledge her
to be a pretty slip of a girl, and we sat in a
corner and I told her about our bloody doings
on the <i>Ajax</i>, until she stopped her ears and
begged me to desist. I regarded Daphne with
condescension, then; but I perceived that she
was sharp of wit and nimble of tongue, much
more so than her cousin, Lady Arabella.</p>

<p>After a while I left Daphne and went back
to watch Lady Arabella. I soon saw that she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>was a very poor player, and lost continually;
but that only whetted her appetite for the game.
Presently a gentleman entered, and, walking
about listlessly, although he seemed to be known
to everybody present, approached me. It was
Captain Overton, as handsome, as <i>distrait</i>, as on
the first and only time I had seen him.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, he recognized me and
came up and spoke to me, making me a very
handsome compliment upon the performances of
the <i>Ajax</i>.</p>

<p>“And is my cousin, Mr. Vernon, here to-night?”
he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>I replied I supposed not; he had received no
card when we had parted that morning, and I
knew of none since.</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad to meet him,” said
Overton. “I think him a fine fellow, in spite
of our disagreement. I see you are not playing.”</p>

<p>“I have no taste for play, strange to say.”</p>

<p>“Do not try to acquire it,” he said; “it is
wrong, you may depend upon it; but indulgence
in it makes many believe it to be right. Every
time you look at a sin, it gets better looking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>I was surprised to hear sin mentioned in the
society of such elegant and well-bred sinners as
I saw around me, who never alluded to it, except
officially, as it were, on Sunday, when they all
declared themselves miserable sinners&mdash;for that
occasion only. Overton then sauntered over
toward Lady Arabella, who seemed to recognize
his approach by instinct. She turned to him,
her cards in her hands, and flushed deeply; he
gazed at her sternly as if in reproof, and, after
a slight remark or two, moved off, to her evident
chagrin.</p>

<p>Daphne being near me then, I said to her
with a forced laugh,&mdash;</p>

<p>“What is the meaning, I beg you to tell me,
of the pantomime between Lady Arabella and
Captain Overton?”</p>

<p>Daphne hesitated, and then said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Captain Overton was one of the gayest
men about London until a year or two ago.
Since then, it is said, he has turned Methody.
It is believed he goes to Mr. Wesley’s meetings,
although he has never been actually caught
there. He lives plainly, and, some say, he gives
his means to the poor; he will not go to the races
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>any more, nor play, and he does not like to see
Arabella play.”</p>

<p>“What has he to do with Arabella?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that I know of, except that she
likes him. He does not like to see any one play
now, although he gamed very high himself at
one time.”</p>

<p>I had seen no particular marks of interest on
Overton’s part toward Lady Arabella; but,
watching her, I saw, in a very little while, the
deepest sort of interest on her part toward him.
She even left the card-table for him, and kept
fast hold of him. I recalled the way she had
striven to attract his attention at the play that
night, more than two years before, and my jealous
soul was illuminated with the knowledge
that she was infatuated with Overton&mdash;and I
was right.</p>

<p>Some time afterward, whom should I see walking
in but Giles Vernon! Lady Hawkshaw
received him most graciously. I went up to
him and asked, “How came you here?”</p>

<p>“Did you think, Dicky, that I meant to let
you keep up a close blockade of the lovely Arabella?
No, indeed; I got a card at seven o’clock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>this evening, by working all day for it, and I
mean to reconnoiter the ground as well as you.”</p>

<p>I thought when he saw Lady Arabella with
Overton that even Giles Vernon’s assurance
would scarcely be equal to accosting her. He
marched himself up with all the coolness in the
world, claiming kinship boldly with Overton,
who couldn’t forbear smiling, and immediately
began to try for favor in Arabella’s eyes.</p>

<p>But here I saw what I never did before or
since with Giles Vernon&mdash;a woman who was
utterly indifferent to him, and actually seemed
to dislike him. She scarcely noticed him at
first, and, when he would not be rebuffed, was so
saucy to him that I wondered he stood it for a
minute. But stand it he did, with the evident
determination to conquer her indifference or dislike,
whichever it might be.</p>

<p>Overton seized the excuse of Giles’ approach
to escape, and left the house, which did not cause
Lady Arabella to like Giles any better. She
returned to the card-table, Giles with her, and,
by the exercise of the most exquisite ingenuity,
he managed to lose some money to her, which
somewhat restored her good humor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>At last the rout was over, and, soon after
midnight, all had gone. I was shown to a bedroom,
with only a partition wall between me and
Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw; so I had the
benefit of the nightly lecture Lady Hawkshaw
gave Sir Peter, with the most unfailing regularity.
On this particular night, they came
nearer agreeing than usual, both of them discussing
anxiously Lady Arabella’s marked fondness
for play. And Lady Hawkshaw told of a
late escapade of Lady Arabella’s in which a certain
ace of clubs was played by her; the said
ace of clubs being fashioned out of black court-plaster
and white cardboard. When detected,
Lady Arabella professed to think the whole
thing a joke, but as her adversary at the time
was a very old lady whose eyesight was notoriously
defective, it took all of Lady Arabella’s
wit and youth to carry it off successfully, which,
however, she did. As for her trinkets, Lady
Arabella was always buying them, and always
taking a distaste to them, so she alleged, and
Lady Hawkshaw suspected they took the place
of shillings at the card-table. Sir Peter
groaned at this, and remarked that the earl, her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>father, was the worst gamester he ever knew,
except her grandfather. I do not remember
any more. I tried to avoid hearing what they
were saying, but every word was distinctly audible
to me, until, at this point, I fell asleep and
dreamed that Lady Hawkshaw was appointed to
command the <i>Ajax</i>, and I was to report on
board next day.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V</h2>
</div>

<p>I spent several weeks in Sir Peter’s house,
and strange weeks they were in many respects.
I never had the least complaint to make of the
kindness of Sir Peter or Lady Hawkshaw, except
that Lady Hawkshaw insisted on investing
my money, all except ten pounds which she gave
me, charging me to be careful with it; but Sir
Peter secretly lent me a considerable sum, to
be repaid at my majority.</p>

<p>Sir Peter was actively at war with all the
women-folk in the household, from his lady
down, except little Daphne. He assumed to
conduct everything in a large town house in
Berkeley Square exactly as if he were on the
<i>Ajax</i>, seventy-four. He desired to have the
lazy London servants called promptly at two
bells, five o’clock in the morning, and to put
them to holystoning, squilgeeing, and swabbing
off the decks, as he called it. Of course the
servants rebelled, and Sir Peter denounced them
as mutineers, and would have dearly liked to put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>them all in double irons. He divided the scullions
and chambermaids into watches, and when
they laughed in his face, threatened them with
the articles of war. He wished everything in
the house stowed away in the least compass possible,
and when Lady Hawkshaw had her routs,
Sir Peter, watch in hand, superintended the removal
of the furniture from the reception-rooms,
which he called clearing for action, and
discharged any servant who was not smart at
his duty. He had a room, which he called his
study, fitted up with all the odds and ends he
had collected during forty years in the navy,
and here he held what might be called drumhead
courts-martial, and disrated the domestic
staff, fined them, swore at them, and bitterly regretted
that the land law did not admit of any
proper discipline whatever.</p>

<p>It may be imagined what a scene of discord
this created, although Sir Peter was of so kind
and generous a nature that the servants took
more from him than from most masters, and,
indeed, rather diverted themselves with his fines
and punishments, and, when dismissed, declined
to leave his service, much to his wrath and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>chagrin. The acme was reached when he attempted
to put the cook in the brig, as he called
a dank cellar which he determined to utilize for
mutineers, as on board ship. The cook, a huge
creature three times as big as Sir Peter, boarded
him in his own particular den, and, brandishing
a rolling-pin that was quite as dangerous as a
cutlass, announced that she would no longer
submit to be governed by the articles of war,
as administered by Sir Peter. She was sustained
by a vociferous chorus of housemaids and
kitchen girls who flocked behind her, the men
rather choosing to remain in the background
and grinning. Sad to say, Admiral Sir Peter
Hawkshaw, C.B., was conquered by the virago
with the rolling-pin, and was forced to surrender
to the mutineers, which he did with a very
bad grace. At that juncture Lady Hawkshaw
hove in sight, and, bearing down upon the company
from below stairs, dispersed them all with
one wave of her hand. Sir Peter complained
bitterly, and Lady Hawkshaw promised to bring
them to summary punishment. But she warned
Sir Peter that his methods were becoming as intolerable
to her as to the rest of the family, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>Sir Peter, after a round or two for the honor
of his flag, hauled down his colors. This became
especially necessary, as his retirement was
at hand, consequent more upon an obstinate
rheumatism that fixed itself upon him than his
age. There was doubt whether he would get
the K.C.B., which he certainly well deserved,
on his retirement; there was some sort of hitch
about it, although, after the capture of the two
French ships, he had been promoted to the office
of admiral. Lady Hawkshaw, however, went
down to the Admiralty in a coach with six horses
and three footmen and four outriders, and,
marching in upon the First Lord, opened fire
on him, with the result that Sir Peter was
gazetted K.C.B. the very next week.</p>

<p>Little Daphne, who had always submitted to
Sir Peter’s whims, did so more than ever after
he had been vanquished by the cook; and Sir
Peter swore, twenty times a week, that Daphne
had the stuff in her to make a sea-officer of the
first order.</p>

<p>My infatuation for Lady Arabella continued:
but I can not say she ever showed me the least
mark of favor. But that she did to no one except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
Overton, and I soon knew what everybody
in the town knew, that she was desperately smitten
with him, and would have bestowed herself
and her fortune upon him at any moment, if he
would but accept it. As for Giles Vernon, she
showed him what no other woman ever did,&mdash;a
coolness at first, that deepened into something
like active hatred. She knew he stood between
Overton and the heirship to the Vernon estates,
and that was enough to make her dislike him.
She often remarked upon his want of good looks,
and she was the only woman I ever knew to do
it. Yet Giles was undeniably hard-featured,
and, except a good figure, had nothing in his
person to recommend him. I had thought that
pride would have kept Giles from paying court
to a person so inimical to him; but pride was the
excuse he gave for still pursuing her. He declared
he had never, no, never, been flouted by a
woman, and that Lady Arabella should yet come
at his call. This I believed at the time to be
mere bravado. He was enchanted by her, that
was the truth, and could no more leave her than
the moth can leave the candle.</p>

<p>I saw much of Daphne in those days, chiefly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>because I could see so little of Lady Arabella,
who led a life of singular independence, little
restrained by the authority of Lady Hawkshaw,
and none at all by Sir Peter. Daphne was fond
of books, and commonly went about with one
under her arm. I, too, was inclined to be bookish;
and so there was something in common between
us. She was keener of wit than any one
in that house; and I soon learned to take delight
in her conversation, in Lady Arabella’s absence.
My love for the Lady Arabella was, I
admit, the fond fancy of a boy; while Giles
Vernon’s was the mad infatuation of a man.</p>

<p>Giles was much with us at that time; and I
acknowledge I had great benefit from the spending
of his prize-money&mdash;or rather, I should
say, much enjoyment. He laid it out right
royally, asked the price of nothing, and, for
the time he was in London, footed it with the
best of them. His lineage and his heirship to
Sir Thomas Vernon gave him entrance anywhere;
and his wit and courage made his place
secure. Shortly after we arrived, Sir Thomas
Vernon also arrived at his house in Grosvenor
Square. We were bound to meet him, for Giles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>went much into gay society, as I did, in the
train of Lady Hawkshaw. The first time this
occurred was at a drum at her Grace of Auchester’s,
where all of London was assembled.
Even Overton, who was rarely seen in drawing-rooms,
was there. Giles, of course, was there;
her Grace had fallen in love with him, as women
usually did, the first time she met him.</p>

<p>It was a great house for play; and when we
arrived, we found the whole suite of splendid
apartments on the lower floor prepared for
cards.</p>

<p>There was the usual crush and clamor of a
fine London party; and I, being young and
unsophisticated, enjoyed it, as did Daphne.
Names were bawled out at the head of the stairs,
but could not be distinguished over the roar of
voices. I happened to be near the door, with
Giles, Lady Arabella being near by, when I
heard the name of Sir Thomas Vernon shouted
out, as he entered.</p>

<p>He was a man of middle size, and was between
forty and fifty years of age. He might
once have been handsome; but the ravages of
an evil nature and a broken constitution were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>plainly visible in his countenance. I observed
that, as he stood, glancing about him before
making his <i>devoirs</i> to the Duchess of Auchester,
no one spoke to him, or seemed disposed to
recognize him. This only brought a sardonic
grin to his countenance. He advanced, and
was civilly, though not cordially, received by
her Grace. At that moment, Giles approached,
and spoke to her, and the change in the great
lady’s manner showed the favor in which she
held him. Sir Thomas scowled upon Giles, but
bowed slightly; and Giles returned the look by
a steady glance, and this stinging remark:</p>

<p>“Good evening, Sir Thomas. You look very
ill. Is your health as desperate as I heard it
was two years ago?”</p>

<p>A titter went around at this, and Giles moved
off, smiling. Sir Thomas was unpopular, there
could be no doubt about that.</p>

<p>Presently Sir Thomas caught sight of Lady
Arabella, and, as usual, he was instantly struck
by her exquisite beauty. He succeeded in being
presented to her, and I noted that she received
him with affability.</p>

<p>About midnight the company broke up, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>our party made a move to go, but Lady Arabella
announced that she had been invited by
her Grace of Auchester to stay the night, and
she wished to do so. Neither Sir Peter nor
Lady Hawkshaw perfectly approved; but Lady
Arabella carried her point, with the assistance
of the duchess. At the last moment, her Grace&mdash;a
fine woman&mdash;approached me, and said
confidentially,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Wynne,&mdash;Glyn, I mean,&mdash;will you
not remain, and share a game with a choice collection
of players?”</p>

<p>I was flattered at being asked; and besides, I
wanted to see how these great London ladies
acted at such play, so I accepted. But it was
another thing to get away from Lady Hawkshaw.
However, I managed to elude her, by
giving a shilling to a footman, who shoved me
into a little closet, and then went and told Lady
Hawkshaw I had gone home in a coach with
a gentleman who had been taken ill, and had
left word for them to go without me. This
pacified her, and she and Sir Peter and Daphne
went away with the crowd. There were left
about twenty persons, who, after a little supper,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>and general expressions of relief at the departure
of the other guests, sat down to play, at
one in the morning. There was a cabinet minister,
also a political parson, two peers of the
realm, several officers of the Guards, Giles Vernon,
and your humble servant. The ladies were
mostly old,&mdash;Lady Arabella was the youngest
of them all,&mdash;but all very great in rank.</p>

<p>I had wanted to see London ladies play&mdash;and
I saw them. Jack, with his greasy cards,
in the forecastle, laying his month’s wages, was
a child to them. And how they watched one
another, and quarreled and fought!</p>

<p>No one among them played so eagerly as
Lady Arabella; and very badly, as usual, so
that she managed to lose all her money. She
was ever a bad player, with all her passion for
play. Her last guinea went; and then, determined
not to be balked, she rose and said,
laughing,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have on a new white satin petticoat, with
lace that cost three guineas the yard. It is very
fit for waistcoats. No gentleman will be so ungallant
as to refuse my petticoat as a stake.”</p>

<p>Of course, they all applauded; and Lady
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>Arabella, retiring behind a screen, emerged with
her satin petticoat&mdash;how it shone and shimmered!&mdash;in
her hand. And in five minutes,
she had lost it to Giles Vernon!</p>

<p>There was much laughter, but Giles, gravely
folding it up, laid it aside; and when we departed,
in the gray light of dawn, he carried
it off under his arm.</p>

<p>As for me, I had lost all the money I had
with me, and had given my I O U for three
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Next day Lady Arabella was dropped in
Berkeley Square by her Grace of Auchester. It
was in the afternoon, and I was sitting in the
Chinese room with Lady Hawkshaw and Daphne
when Lady Arabella appeared.</p>

<p>“Well, Dicky,” she said,&mdash;a very offensive
mode of addressing me,&mdash;“how do you stand
your losses at play?” And, as I am a sinner,
she plumped out the whole story of my play to
Lady Hawkshaw and Daphne. As an officer
and a gentleman, I scorned to retaliate by telling
of the white satin petticoat. But vengeance
was at hand. Just as she had finished, when
Lady Hawkshaw was swelling with rage, like a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>toad, before opening her main batteries on me,
and Daphne’s fair eyes were full of contempt
for me, we heard a commotion outside. None
of us could keep from going to the window, and
the sight we saw threw Lady Arabella into a
perfect tempest of angry tears.</p>

<p>A fife and drum were advancing up the street,
playing with great vigor the old tune known
as “Petticoats Loose.” Behind them marched,
with the deepest gravity, a couple of marines,
bearing aloft on their muskets a glittering shimmering
thing that fluttered whitely in the air.
It was Lady Arabella’s satin petticoat; and,
halting before the door, the drum, with a great
flourish, pounded the knocker. On the porter’s
responding, the two marines handed the petticoat
in with ceremony to him, directing him to
convey it to the Lady Arabella Stormont, with
the compliments of Lieutenant Giles Vernon of
his Majesty’s service. This the man did, and
was almost torn to pieces by her for doing so,
though in what way he had offended, I know
not to this day. It was a trifling thing, and
made laughter for us all (including Lady
Hawkshaw), except Arabella. She seemed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>hate Giles with a more virulent hatred after
that, and tried very hard to induce Lady Hawkshaw
to forbid him the house, which, however,
Lady Hawkshaw refused to do.</p>

<p class="caption no-indent">It was Lady Arabella’s satin petticoat.  <i>Page <a href="#Page_92">92</a></i></p>

<p>Neither Giles nor I had by any means forgotten
our appointment to meet Captain Overton
on the field of honor; and as the time
approached for the meeting, Giles sent a very
civil note to Overton, asking him to name a gentleman
who would see me to arrange the preliminaries,
for I would never have forgiven Giles
had he chosen any one else. Overton responded,
naming our old first lieutenant, Mr. Buxton,
who happened to be in London then, and was an
acquaintance of his. I believe Overton’s object
in asking Mr. Buxton to act for him was
the hope that the affair might be arranged; for
from what I had heard of the deeply religious
turn Overton had taken, I concluded the meeting
was somewhat against his conscience. But the
indignity of a blow in the face to an officer
could not be easily wiped out without an exchange
of shots. My principal was much disgusted
when Mr. Buxton was named.</p>

<p>“I know how it will be, Dicky,” he growled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>“You will sit like a great gaby, with your
mouth open, imagining the tavern parlor to be
the cockpit of the <i>Ajax</i>. Mr. Buxton will talk
to you in his quarter-deck voice, and you will
be so frightened that you will agree to use bird-shot
at forty paces, provided Mr. Buxton proposes
it.”</p>

<p>This I indignantly denied, and swore I would
meet Mr. Buxton as man to man. Nevertheless,
when we were sitting at the table in Mr.
Buxton’s lodgings, I did very much as Giles
had predicted. I forgot several things that I
had wished to say, and said several things I
wished I had forgotten. Mr. Buxton did not
let me forget, however, that he had been my
first lieutenant, and I was but a midshipman.
He called my principal a hot-headed jackanapes
before my very face, adding angrily,&mdash;</p>

<p>“But for him I should have been first on the
<i>Indomptable’s</i> deck.” To all this I made but a
feeble protest; and finally it was arranged that
the meeting should take place at a spot very
near Richmond, at eight o’clock, on the morning
of June the twenty-ninth.</p>

<p>When the date was set, and the arrangements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>made, I began to feel very much frightened.
Not so Giles. There was to be a great ball at
Almack’s on the night of the twenty-eighth and
Giles announced that he was going. It was a
very special occasion for him, because the
Trenchard, whom he still called the divine Sylvia,
and professed to admire as much as ever,
was to go that night. She was then the rage,
and had a carriage, diamonds, and a fine establishment,
yet I believe her conduct to have been
irreproachable. She had long been consumed
with a desire to go to Almack’s, but up to that
time no actress had ever yet enjoyed the privilege.
It seemed grotesque enough that a young
midshipman, of no more consequence than Giles
Vernon, should succeed in carrying this through.
But such was actually the case; and Giles accomplished
it by that singular power he possessed,
by which no woman could say him nay.
He worked with much art upon those great
ladies, her Grace of Auchester and Lady Conyngham,
and got them pledged to it. Of
course, the most violent opposition was developed;
but Giles, who had a perfect knowledge
of the feminine heart, managed to inspire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>these two ladies with the wish to exercise their
sovereignty over Almack’s, by doing what was
never done before. Having led them into the
fight, they had no thought of running away;
and the result was innumerable heartburnings
and jealousies, and meanwhile a card for Mrs.
Trenchard.</p>

<p>The noise of the controversy was heard all
over town, and it was discussed in Berkeley
Square as elsewhere. Lady Hawkshaw was no
longer a subscriber to Almack’s. Not being
able to rule it, she had retired, the assembly
rooms not being large enough to hold herself
and a certain other lady.</p>

<p>Giles had told me that on the evening of the
ball he and other gentlemen interested in the
victory for Mrs. Trenchard would escort her to
the ball. So at eight o’clock I proceeded to
the lady’s house in Jermyn Street, and saw her
set forth in state in her chair. She was blazing
with diamonds, and looked like a stage duchess.
A long company of gentlemen with their swords
attended her, and Giles and my Lord Winstanley
led the procession. Mrs. Trenchard was the
best imitation of a lady I ever saw, as she sat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>in her chair, smiling and fanning herself, with
the linkboys gaping and grinning at her; and
the gentlemen especially, such as had had a
little more wine than usual, shouting, “Way
for Mrs. Trenchard! Make way there!”</p>

<p>Yet it seemed to me as if she were only an
imitation, after all, and that Lady Hawkshaw,
with her turban and her outlandish French, had
much more the genuine air of a great lady.
Mrs. Trenchard would go to Almack’s on any
terms, but Lady Hawkshaw would not go, except
she ruled the roost, and fought gallantly
with the duchesses and countesses, only retiring
from the field because she was one against many.</p>

<p>I followed the merry procession until we got
to King Street, St. James’s, where the coaches
were four deep, and footmen, in regiments,
blockaded the street. Giles and Lord Winstanley
were to take Mrs. Trenchard in, and very
grand the party looked as they entered. By
that time, though, I was very miserable. I remembered
that at the same time the next night,
I might not have my friend. I hung around
among the footmen and idlers, watching the
lights and listening to the crash of the music,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>quite unconscious of the flight of time, and was
astonished when the ball was over and the people
began pouring out. Then, afraid to be
caught by Giles, I ran home as fast as my legs
could carry me.</p>

<p>When I reached Berkeley Square, it was altogether
dark, and I realized that I was locked
out.</p>

<p>I looked all over the front of the house, and
my heart sank. There was a blind alley at one
side, and I remembered that in it opened the
window of Sir Peter’s study, as he called it,
although, as I have said, it was more like the
cubby-hole of the <i>Ajax</i> than any other place
I can call to mind. The window was at least
twenty feet from the ground, but a waterspout
ran up the wall beside it, and to a midshipman,
used to going out on the topsail-yard, it was
a trifle to get up to the window. I climbed up,
softly tried the window, and to my joy found it
open. In another minute I was standing inside
the room. I had my flint and steel in my
pocket, and I groped about until I found a
candle, which I lighted.</p>

<p>I had often been in the room before, but its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>grotesque appearance struck me afresh, and I
could not forbear laughing, although I was in
no laughing mood. There was a regular ship’s
transom running around the wall. The whole
room was full of the useless odds and ends that
accumulate on board a ship, all arranged with
the greatest neatness and economy of space,
and there was not one single object in the room
which could possibly be of the slightest use on
shore.</p>

<p>I looked around to see how I could make myself
comfortable for the night, and, opening
a locker in the wall, I found a collection of old
boat-cloaks of Sir Peter’s, in every stage of
dilapidation, but all laid away with the greatest
care. Taking one for my pillow and two more
for my coverlet, I lay down on the transom and,
blowing out the candle, was soon in a sound
sleep.</p>

<p>I was awakened at five o’clock in the morning
by the chiming of a neighboring church
bell, and at the same moment, I saw the door
to the room noiselessly open, and Lady Arabella
Stormont enter, carrying a candle which
she shaded with her hand. I involuntarily covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
my head up, thinking she had probably
come in search of something, and would be
alarmed if a man suddenly jumped from the pile
of boat-cloaks. But she went to a glass door
which led out upon a balcony, with stairs into
the garden, and unlocked the door. I had
completely forgotten about these stairs, not being
familiar with the room, when I climbed up
and got in through the window.</p>

<p>Presently I heard a step upon the stairs, and
before the person who was coming had time to
knock, Lady Arabella opened the door. The
rosy dawn of a clear June morning made it light
outside, but inside the room it was quite dark,
except for the candle carried by Lady Arabella.</p>

<p>A man entered, and as soon as he was in the
room, she noiselessly locked the door, and, unseen
by him, put the key in her pocket.</p>

<p>As he turned, and the candlelight fell upon
his face, I saw it was Philip Overton. Amazement
was pictured in his face, and in his voice,
too, when he spoke.</p>

<p>“I was sent for in haste, by Sir Peter, just
now,” he said, with some confusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>
<p>At which Lady Arabella laughed, as if it
were a very good joke that he should find her
instead of Sir Peter. Meanwhile, my own chaos
of mind prevented me from understanding fully
what they were saying; but I gathered that
Lady Arabella had devised some trick, in which
she had freely used Sir Peter Hawkshaw’s
name to get Overton there in that manner and in
that room. Sir Peter was such a very odd fish
that no one was surprised at what he did. It
was no use striving not to listen,&mdash;they were
not five feet from me,&mdash;and I lay there in terror,
realizing that I was in a very dangerous
position. I soon discovered that Overton’s reputation
for lately-acquired Methodistical piety
had not done away with a very hot temper.
He was enraged, as only a man can be who is entrapped,
and demanded at once of Lady Arabella
to be let out of the glass door, when he
found it locked. She refused to tell him where
the key was, and he threatened to break the
glass and escape that way.</p>

<p>“Do it then, if you wish,” she cried, “and
rouse the house and the neighborhood, and ruin
me if you will. But before you do it, read this,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>and then know what Arabella Stormont can do
for the man she loves!”</p>

<p>She thrust a letter into his hand, and, slipping
out of the door to the corridor, as swiftly
and silently as a swallow in its flight, she locked
it after her; Overton was a prisoner in Sir
Peter’s room. He tore the letter open, read the
few lines it contained, and then threw it down
with an oath. The next minute he caught sight
of me; in my surprise I had forgotten all my
precautions, and had half arisen.</p>

<p>“You hound!” he said. “Are you in this
infernal plot?” And he kicked the boat-cloaks
off me.</p>

<p>“I am not,” said I coolly, recalled to myself
by the term he had used toward me; “and neither
am I a hound. You will kindly remember to
account to me for that expression, Captain
Overton.”</p>

<p>“Read that,” he cried, throwing Lady Arabella’s
letter toward me. I think he meant not
to do a dishonorable thing in giving me the
letter to read, but it was an act of involuntary
rage.</p>

<p>It read thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know that you were to fight Mr. Vernon
at eight o’clock this morning, therefore I beguiled
you here; for your life is dearer to me
than anything in heaven and earth; and I will
not let you out until that very hour, when it will
be too late for you to get to Twickenham.
You will not dare to raise a commotion in the
house at this hour, which would ruin us both.
But by the jeopardy in which I placed myself
this night, you will know how true is the love of</p>

<p><span class="right4">“<i>Arabella Stormont</i>.”</span></p></div>

<p>I confess that the reading of this letter made
me a partizan of Overton; for surely no more
unhandsome trick was ever played upon a gentleman.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to sit down and
wait for eight o’clock. Sir Peter’s family were
late risers, and there was little danger of detection
at that hour. So we sat, and gazed at each
other, mute before the mystery of the good and
evil in a woman’s love. I confess the experience
was new to me.</p>

<p>“You will bear me witness, Mr. Glyn,” said
Overton, “that I am detained here against my
will; but I think it a piece of good fortune that
you are detained with me.”</p>

<p>“I will bear witness to nothing, sir,” I replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
“until you have given me satisfaction for
calling me a hound, just now.”</p>

<p>“Dear sir, pray forget that hasty expression.
In my rage and amazement, just now, I
would have called the commander-in-chief of the
forces a hound. Pray accept every apology
that a gentleman can make. I was quite beside
myself, as you must have seen.”</p>

<p>I saw that he was very anxious to conciliate
me; for upon my testimony alone would rest
the question of whether he voluntarily or involuntarily
failed to appear at the meeting arranged
for eight o’clock.</p>

<p>I also perceived the strength of my position,
and a dazzling idea presented itself to my mind.</p>

<p>“I will agree,” said I, “to testify to everything
in your favor, if you will but promise me
not to&mdash;not to&mdash;” I hesitated, ashamed to
express my womanish fears for Giles Vernon’s
life; but he seemed to read my thoughts.</p>

<p>“Do you mean, not to do Mr. Vernon any
harm in the meeting which will, of course, take
place, the instant it can be arranged? That I
promise you; for I never had any personal animosity
toward Mr. Vernon. His blow, like my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>words just now, was the outburst of passion,
and not a deliberate insult.”</p>

<p>I was overjoyed at this; and as I sat, grinning
in my delight, I must have been in strong
contrast to Overton, in the very blackness of
rage.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged slowly on, and we heard
the clock strike six and seven. The dim light
of a foggy morning stole in at the windows.
Not a soul was stirring in the house; but on the
stroke of eight, a light step fluttered near the
outer door. It was softly unlocked, and Lady
Arabella entered, carefully locking the door on
the inside, after her, this time. In the ghostly
half-light, Overton rose, and saluted her with
much ceremony.</p>

<p>“Lady Arabella Stormont,” he said, “you
have delayed the meeting between Mr. Vernon
and myself just twenty-four hours. To do it,
you have put my honor in jeopardy, and that
I shall not soon forget. I beg you to open the
glass door, and allow me to bid you farewell.”</p>

<p>She stopped, as if paralyzed for a moment,
when I, knowing the key to be in her pocket,
deftly fished it out, and opened the door, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>Overton walked out. She could not stop me,&mdash;I
was too quick for her,&mdash;but she ran after
me, and fetched me a box on the ear, which did
more than sting my cheek and my pride. It
killed, in one single instant of time, the boyish
love I had had for her, ever since the first hour
I had seen her. I own I was afraid to retaliate
as a gentleman should, by kissing her violently;
but dashing on, I sped down the steps outside,
after Overton, not caring to remain alone with
the Lady Arabella. I saw her no more that
day, nor until the afternoon of the next day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI</h2></div>

<p>As Overton had said, the meeting was delayed
exactly twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>My courage always has an odd way of disappearing
when I am expecting to use it, although
I must say, when I have had actual occasion for
it, I have always found it easily at hand. I
can not deny that I was very much frightened
for Giles on the morning of the meeting, and,
to add to my misery, I heard that Overton was
considered one of the best shots in England.</p>

<p>The dreary breakfast gulped down; the post-chaise
rattling up to the door&mdash;I had hoped
until the last moment that it would not come;
the bumping along the road in the cool, bright
summer morning; the gruesome, long, narrow
box that lay on the front seat of the chaise;
the packet of letters which Giles had given me
and which seemed to weigh a hundred tons in
my pocket,&mdash;all these were so many horrors to
haunt the memory for ever. But I must say
that, apparently, the misery was all mine; for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>I never saw Giles Vernon show so much as by
the flicker of an eyelash that he was disturbed
in any way.</p>

<p>About half-way from the meeting-ground we
left the highway and turned into a by-road;
and scarcely had we gone half a mile when we
almost drove into a broken-down chaise, and
standing on the roadside among the furze
bushes were the coachman, the surgeon,&mdash;a
most bloody-minded man I always believed him,&mdash;Mr.
Buxton, and Overton.</p>

<p>Our chaise stopped, and Giles, putting his
head out of the window, said pleasantly, “Good
morning, gentlemen; you have had an accident,
I see.”</p>

<p>“A bad one,” replied Mr. Buxton, who saw
that their chaise was beyond help, and who, as
he said afterward, was playing for a place in
our chaise, not liking to walk the rest of the
distance.</p>

<p>Giles jumped out and so did I, and the most
courteous greetings were exchanged.</p>

<p>The two drivers, as experts, examined the
broken chaise, and agreed there was no patching
it up for service; one wheel was splintered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Buxton looked at Giles meaningly, and
then at me, and Giles whispered to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Offer to take ’em up. By Jupiter, they
shall see we are no shirkers.”</p>

<p>Which I did, and, to my amazement, in a few
moments we were all lumbering along the road;
Overton and Mr. Buxton on the back seat, and
Giles and I with our backs to the horses, while
the surgeon was alongside the coachman on the
box.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the politeness between
the two principals, about the seats as about
everything else. Overton was with difficulty
persuaded to take the back seat. Mr. Buxton
seated himself there without any introduction.
(I hope it will never again be my fortune to
negotiate so delicate an affair as a meeting
between gentlemen, with one so much my superior
in rank as Mr. Buxton.)</p>

<p>“May I ask, Mr. Overton, if you prefer the
window down or up?” asked Giles, with great
deference.</p>

<p>“Either, dear sir,” responded Overton. “I
believe it was up when you kindly invited us
to enter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“True; but you may be sensitive to the air,
and may catch cold.”</p>

<p>At which Mr. Buxton grinned in a heartless
manner. The window remained up.</p>

<p>We were much crowded with the two pistol-cases
and the surgeon’s box of instruments,
which to me appeared more appalling than the
pistols.</p>

<p>At last we reached the spot,&mdash;a small, flat
place under a sweetly-blooming hawthorn hedge,
with some verdant oaks at either end.</p>

<p>Giles and Overton were so scrupulous about
taking precedence of each other in getting out
of the chaise, that I had strong hopes the day
would pass before they came to a decision; but
Mr. Buxton finally got out himself and pulled
his man after him, and then we were soon
marking off the ground, and I was feeling that
mortal sickness which had attacked me the first
time I was under fire in the <i>Ajax</i>.</p>

<p>Overton won the toss for position, and at
that I could have lain down and wept.</p>

<p>Our men were placed twenty paces apart,
with their backs to each other. At the word
“one,” they were to turn, advance and fire between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the words “two” and “three.” This
seemed to me the most murderous arrangement
I had ever heard of.</p>

<p>The stories I had so lately heard about Overton’s
proficiency with the pistol made me think,
even if he did not kill Giles intentionally, he
would attempt some expert trick with the pistol,
which would do the business equally well. I
knew Giles to be a very poor shot, and concluded
that he, through awkwardness, would
probably put an end to Overton, and I regarded
them both as doomed men.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my feelings as we were
placing our men, or after Mr. Buxton and I had
retired to a place under the hedge. Just as we
had selected our places, Giles, looking over his
shoulder, said in his usual cool, soft voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, gentlemen, you had better
move two or three furlongs off? Mr. Overton
may grow excited and fire wild.”</p>

<p>I thought this a most dangerous as well as
foolish speech, and calculated to irritate Overton;
and for the first time I saw a gleam of
anger in his eye, which had hitherto been mild,
and even sad. For I believed then, and knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>afterward, that his mind was far from easy on
the subject of dueling. I wish to say here that
I also believe, had he been fully convinced that
dueling was wrong, he would have declined to
fight, no matter what the consequences had been;
for I never knew a man with more moral courage.
But at the time, although his views were
changing on the subject, they were not wholly
changed.</p>

<p>Mr. Buxton, without noticing Giles’ speech,
coughed once or twice, and then waited two or
three minutes before giving the word.</p>

<p>The summer sun shone brilliantly, turning
the distant river to a silver ribbon. A thrush
rioted musically in the hawthorn hedge. All
things spoke of life and hope, but to my sinking
heart insensate Nature only mocked us. I
heard, as in a dream, the words “One, two,
three” slowly uttered by Mr. Buxton, and saw,
still as in a dream, both men turn and raise
their pistols.</p>

<p>Overton’s was discharged first; then, as he
stood like a man in marble waiting for his
adversary’s fire, Giles raised his pistol and, taking
deliberate aim at the bird still singing in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>the hedge, brought it down. It was a mere
lucky shot, but Overton took off his hat and
bowed to the ground, and Giles responded by
taking off his hat and showing a hole through
the brim.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo6"><img src="images/i_113.jpg" width="400" alt="Overton took off his hat and bowed." /></a></div>

<p class="caption no-indent">Overton took off his hat and bowed.  <i>Page <a href="#Page_113">113</a></i></p>

<p>“You see, Mr. Glyn,” said Overton, “I have
done according to my promise. It was not my
intention to kill Mr. Vernon, but only to
frighten him,”&mdash;which speech Mr. Buxton and
I considered as a set-off to Giles’ speech just
before shots were exchanged.</p>

<p>The two principals remained where they were,
while Mr. Buxton and I retired behind the hedge
to confer&mdash;or rather for Mr. Buxton to say to
me,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Another shot would be damned nonsense.
My man is satisfied, or shall be, else I am a
Dutch trooper. Certainly you have nothing to
complain of.”</p>

<p>I was only too happy to accept this solution,
but more out of objection to being browbeaten
by Mr. Buxton than anything else, I said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“We shall require an explanation of your
principal’s observation just now, sir.”</p>

<p>“Shall you?” angrily asked Mr. Buxton,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>exactly in the tone he used when the carpenter’s
mate complained that the jack-o’-the-dust had
cribbed his best saw. “Then I shall call your
man to account in regard to his late observation,
and we can keep them popping away at each
other all day. But this is no slaughter-pen,
Mr. Glyn, nor am I the ship’s butcher, and I
shall take my man back to town and give him
a glass of spirits and some breakfast, and I
advise you to do the same. You are very
young, Mr. Glyn, and you still need to know
a thing or two.” Then, advancing from behind
the hedge, he said in the dulcet tone he used
when the admiral asked him to have wine,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, Mr. Glyn and myself, after
conferring, have agreed that the honor of our
principals is fully established, and that the controversy
is completely at an end. Allow me
to congratulate you both,”&mdash;and there was a
general hand-shaking all around. I noticed
that the coachman, who was attentively watching
the performance, looked slightly disappointed
at the turn of affairs.</p>

<p>Straightway, we all climbed into the chaise,
and I think I shall be believed when I say that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>our return to town was more cheerful than our
departure had been.</p>

<p>We all agreed to dine together at Mivart’s
the next night, and I saw no reason to believe
that there was any remnant of ill feeling between
the two late combatants.</p>

<p>I returned to Berkeley Square that afternoon,
with much uneasiness concerning my meeting
and future intercourse with Lady Arabella; for
I had not seen her since the occurrence in Sir
Peter’s study. Although my affection for her
was for ever killed by that box on the ear she
gave me, yet no man can see a woman shamed
before him without pain, and the anticipation
of Lady Arabella’s feelings when she saw me
troubled me. But this was what actually happened
when we met. Lady Arabella was sitting
in the Chinese drawing-room, her lap-dog
in her arms, surrounded by half a dozen fops.
Lady Hawkshaw had left the room for a
moment, and Arabella had taken the opportunity
of showing her trick of holding out her
dog’s paws and kissing his nose, which she
called measuring love-ribbon. This performance
never failed to throw gentlemen into ecstasies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Daphne sat near, with her work in her
lap and a book on the table by her, smiling
rather disdainfully. I do not think the cousins
loved each other.</p>

<p>On my appearance in the drawing-room, I
scarcely dared look toward Lady Arabella; but
she called out familiarly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Come here, Dicky!” (her habit of calling
me Dicky annoyed me very much), “and let me
show you how I kiss Fido’s nose; and if you are
a good boy, and will tell me all about the meeting
this morning, perhaps I may hold your paws
out and kiss your nose,”&mdash;at which all the
gentlemen present laughed loudly. I never was
so embarrassed in my life, and my chagrin was
increased when, suddenly dropping the dog, she
rushed at me, seized my hands, and, holding
them off at full arm’s length, imprinted a sounding
smack upon my nose, and laughingly cried
out, “One yard!” ( Smack on my nose again.)
“Two yards!” (Smack.) “Three yards!”
(Smack.)</p>

<p>At this juncture I recovered my presence of
mind enough to seize her around the waist, and
return her smacks with interest full in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>mouth. And at this stage of the proceedings
Lady Hawkshaw appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>In an instant an awful hush fell upon us.
For my part I felt my knees sinking under me,
and I had that feeling of mortal sickness which
I had felt in my first sea-fight, and at the
instant I thought my friend’s life in jeopardy.
Lady Arabella stood up, for once, confused.
The gentlemen all retired gracefully to the wall,
in order not to interrupt the proceedings, and
Daphne fixed her eyes upon me, sparkling with
indignation.</p>

<p>Lady Hawkshaw’s voice, when she spoke,
seemed to come from the tombs of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>“What is this <i>countrytom</i> I see?” she asked.
And nobody answered a word.</p>

<p>Jeames, the tall footman, stood behind her;
and to him she turned, saying in a tone like
thunder,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Jeames, go and tell Sir Peter Hawkshaw
that I desire his presence immediately upon a
matter of the greatest importance.”</p>

<p>The footman literally ran down stairs, and
presently Sir Peter came puffing up from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>lower regions. Lady Arabella had recovered
herself then enough to hum a little tune and
to pat the floor with her satin slipper.</p>

<p>Sir Peter walked in, surveyed us all, and
turned pale. I verily believe he thought Arabella
had been caught cheating at cards.</p>

<p>“Sir Peter,” said Lady Hawkshaw, in the
same awful voice, “I unexpectedly entered this
room a few moments ago, and the sight that
met my eyes was Arabella struggling in the
arms of this young ruffian, Richard Glyn, who
was kissing her with the greatest fury imaginable.”</p>

<p>Sir Peter looked at me very hard, and after
a moment said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Have you nothing to say for yourself,
young gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” I replied, trying to assume a firm
tone, “I will only say that Lady Arabella,
meaning to treat me like her lap-dog, kissed me
on the nose, as she does that beast of hers; and
as an officer and a gentleman, I felt called upon
to pay her back; and for every smack she gave
me on my nose, I gave her two back in the
mouth, to show her that an officer in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>Majesty’s sea-service is a man, and not a lap-dog.”</p>

<p>“Do you hear that, Sir Peter?” asked Lady
Hawkshaw, with terrible earnestness. “He
does not deny his guilt. What think you of
his conduct?”</p>

<p>“Think, ma’am!” shouted Sir Peter, “I
think if he had done anything else, it would
have been clean against the articles of war, and
I myself would have seen that he was kicked
out of his Majesty’s service. I shall send for
my solicitor, to-morrow morning, to put a codicil
to my will, giving Richard Glyn a thousand
pounds at my decease.”</p>

<p>At this the gentlemen roared, and Lady Arabella,
seizing the lap-dog, hid her face in his
long hair, while even Daphne smiled and
blushed. As for Lady Hawkshaw, for once she
was disconcerted and walked out, glaring over
her shoulder at Sir Peter.</p>

<p>There was much laughter, Sir Peter joining
in; but after a while the gentlemen left, and
Sir Peter went out, and Daphne, who I saw was
disgusted with my conduct, walked haughtily
away, in spite of Lady Arabella’s playful protests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
that she was afraid to remain alone in the
room with me.</p>

<p>One thing had puzzled me extremely, and
that was her calmness, and even gaiety, when
she had no means of knowing how Overton had
come off in the meeting, and I said to her,&mdash;</p>

<p>“How did you know, or do you know,
whether Philip Overton and Giles Vernon are
alive at this moment?”</p>

<p>“By your face, Dicky,” she answered, trying
to give me a fillip on the nose, which I successfully
resisted. “I was in agony until I saw
your face. Then I gave one great breath of
joy and relief, and my play with my lap-dog,
which had been torture to me, became delight.
But tell me the particulars.”</p>

<p>“No, Madam,” said I; “I tell you nothing.”</p>

<p>This angered her, and she said, after a moment,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I presume you will take an early opportunity
of telling Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw
that I saw Philip Overton alone in this house, at
five o’clock yesterday morning?”</p>

<p>“I am quite unaware, Madam,” replied I,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>stung by this, “of anything in my character
or conduct which could induce you to think
such a thing of me.”</p>

<p>“You made me no promise not to tell,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. But some things are considered
universally binding among gentlemen,
and one is to tell nothing to the disadvantage
of a woman. I neither made, nor will make, a
promise about that affair; but if it is ever
known, it will be you or Overton who tells it,
not I.”</p>

<p>And I walked out of the room.</p>

<p>I speedily found, after that, my life in Berkeley
Square uncomfortable. I felt constrained
before Lady Arabella, and, what seemed strange
to me, little Daphne, who had hitherto treated
me with greatest kindness, seemed to take a
spite at me, and her gibes and cuts were hard
to bear. Neither Sir Peter nor Lady Hawkshaw
noted these things, but they were strong enough
to impel me to ask Sir Peter to look out for
a ship for me at the Admiralty.</p>

<p>I saw Giles Vernon every day, and he continued
to come, with unabated assurance, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>Berkeley Square. We were not anxious that
the fact of the duel should leak out, and Overton
was especially desirous to keep it quiet.
Of course, he came no more to Berkeley Square,
and withdrew more and more from his former
associates. He began to consort much with
persons of the John Wesley persuasion, spending
much of his time, when not on duty, at
Oxford, where the Wesleyans were numerous
at the time. I noticed that Lady Arabella
treated Giles, and me, also, with more civility
than she had hitherto shown. I could not think
it sincere, but attributed it to a natural desire
to conciliate those who knew so much to her
disadvantage. But that she made no effort to
overcome her infatuation for Overton, I very
soon had proof. Sir Thomas Vernon, soon after
this, had the assurance to present himself in
Berkeley Square, and rare sport it was. Lady
Hawkshaw, Lady Arabella, Daphne, myself, and
one or two other persons were in the Chinese
drawing-room when he was ushered in.</p>

<p>Lady Hawkshaw and Sir Thomas were old
acquaintances, and had been at feud for more
than thirty years, neither side asking or giving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>quarter. Sir Thomas had a shrewd wit of his
own, and was more nearly a match for Lady
Hawkshaw than any one I had yet seen. He
opened the ball by remarking on Lady Hawkshaw’s
improved appearance, partly due, he
thought, to her triumph in getting the K. C. B.
for Sir Peter. This nettled Lady Hawkshaw
extremely, and she retaliated by telling Sir
Thomas that he looked younger than he did
when she first knew him, thirty years ago. As
Sir Thomas hated any allusion to his age, this
shot told.</p>

<p>“And allow me to congratulate you, Sir
Thomas,” added Lady Hawkshaw, “upon your
very promising cousin, Mr. Giles Vernon. Sir
Peter has the highest opinion of him, and he
has won the favor of the <i>bong-tong</i> to an extraordinary
degree.”</p>

<p>“He may have won the favor of the <i>bong-tong</i>,”
replied Sir Thomas, impudently mimicking
Lady Hawkshaw’s French, “but he has not
yet succeeded in winning <i>my</i> favor.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pity,” said Lady Hawkshaw; “but
it doesn’t signify, I dare say. It will not keep
you alive a day longer. And there is your other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>cousin&mdash;Captain Overton of the Guards. He
is what so few of our young men are, pious and
God-fearing.”</p>

<p>“And a sniveling, John Wesley Methodist
besides,” snarled Sir Thomas, much exasperated.</p>

<p>“Bless me, Sir Thomas,” cried Lady Hawkshaw,
“don’t be so hard on those worthy people,
the Methodists.”</p>

<p>I own this surprised me, for if there was
anything on earth upon which Lady Hawkshaw
was uncompromising, it was Church and State;
and, excellent woman though she was, I believe
she would have been rather glad to make one
big bonfire of all the dissenters in England.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas was far from insensible to Lady
Arabella’s charms, and, after a further exchange
of hostilities with Lady Hawkshaw, turned to
Arabella. She smiled upon him, and seemed
anxious to conciliate him; and in a little while I
caught enough of their conversation to know
that she was telling him of the meeting between
Giles and Overton, and representing that it had
been forced upon Overton by the insults of Giles
Vernon. Sir Thomas’ response to her tale was
that he did not give a damn for either of them,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>and if both had bit the dust he should not have
been sorry.</p>

<p>When Sir Thomas left, Lady Hawkshaw
called the tall footman.</p>

<p>“Jeames,” she said, “when that&mdash;person
calls again, the ladies are not at home. Do
you understand?”</p>

<p>Jeames understood perfectly, in spite of Lady
Arabella’s scowls.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that a young man
of Giles Vernon’s spirit had not been able to go
through with his prize-money and run pretty
considerably in debt in five or six weeks in
London, and one morning, some days after this,
when I went to see Giles at his lodgings, I found
the bailiffs in possession. Giles, however, was
as merry as a grig, because that very morning
he had got an appointment to the <i>Belvidera</i>
frigate.</p>

<p>It was not much after having served in
the <i>Ajax</i>, but it meant leaving that uncertain
and trying element, dry land, for another element
on which Giles was much more at home,
to wit, the blue sea. So he sent out for a pot of
porter, and he and I, together with the bailiffs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>drank to the <i>Belvidera</i>; and I swore, then and
there, that go with him I would. For, in the
excess of my affection for Giles, I would have
taken almost any service to be with him. The
frigates, too, were more in the way of activity,
as the enemy was wary of meeting our ships
of the line, but the frigates could go hunting
after him. So, when I returned to Berkeley
Square that day, I begged Sir Peter to get me
a berth in the <i>Belvidera</i>. He was pleased with
my spirit, and the very next day he went to
the Admiralty for me. The complement was
full, but, luckily for me, one of the juniors got
a billet more to his liking, and Sir Peter, being
on the spot, got me the vacancy, and I was
ordered to report at once at Plymouth.</p>

<p>It took me but a day or two to get my outfit
and make ready to start. Lady Hawkshaw
showed me great kindness then, and actually
allowed me to have a considerable sum of my
own money. Lady Arabella treated me with her
usual indifference, and, on the day I was to go,
bade me a careless adieu.</p>

<p>When the post-chaise was at the door and I
went to the Chinese drawing-room to tell Lady
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>Hawkshaw and Sir Peter good-by, Daphne was
there with them, and she looked as if she had
been weeping. Sir Peter gave me a letter to
my new captain, Vere, and some words of encouragement.
Lady Hawkshaw delivered a
homily to me on my duty, which I received out
of respect for her real excellence of heart, and
thanked her in a manner which made Sir Peter
my friend for life. Daphne said not a word
when I took her hand, but handing me a little
parcel ran out of the room. I afterward found
it to be a little housewife made by her own
hands.</p>

<p>I went down to the chaise, puzzled at her conduct,
but, looking up for the last time to the
windows, I saw her peering from behind a curtain.
I raised the parcel to my lips, and, as she
saw it, a smile broke over her face. My last
glimpse of her was like an April day,&mdash;she was
all smiles and tears,&mdash;and it was destined to remain
in my memory.</p>

<p>Giles Vernon was waiting for me at the
corner of the street. We were to make the
journey to Plymouth together.</p>

<p>“Well,” he cried, when we found ourselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>rolling along to meet the coach, “I have had
my cake and eaten it.”</p>

<p>“How I envy you!” I said bitterly. “I
have not had my cake. Every shilling of my
prize-money is in bank, except about two hundred
pounds.”</p>

<p>“Poor chap!” answered Giles feelingly.
“How much more of life have I seen in London
than you! I have seen everything, including
that queen of hearts, Lady Arabella Stormont.
She has treated me cruelly, the jade! But I
will bring her to my hand at last, that I swear
to you.”</p>

<p>I longed that he might know of that episode
with Overton in Sir Peter Hawkshaw’s cubby-hole
at five o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>We had a pleasant journey to Plymouth, and
were troubled with few regrets at leaving London.
We expected, in the foolishness of youth,
to capture many more such prizes as the <i>Indomptable</i>
and <i>Xantippe</i>. The <i>Belvidera</i> was
nearly ready, and in a few weeks we sailed on
our second cruise. I shall not give the particulars
of that cruise. It was such an one
as all the officers of his Majesty’s service were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>engaged in, during those eventful years. We
were constantly at sea; we kept a tireless lookout
for our enemies, and hunted and pursued
them into their own harbors. We never slept
for more than four hours at a time, in all our
cruising. We lived on beef and biscuit for
months at a time; sometimes we had scurvy
in the ship, and sometimes we did not. We
struggled with mighty gales, that blew us hundreds
and even thousands of miles out of our
course; and we sweltered in calms that tried
men’s souls. In all that time, we watched
night and day for the enemy, and, when found,
chased him, and never failed to get alongside
when it was possible; and we fought him with
the greatest good-will. We had good and ill
fortune with the ship, but her colors were never
lowered. And it was five years before we set
foot in London town again.</p>

<p>Only a year of that time was Giles Vernon
with me. He then got promotion which took
him out of the ship. I had the extreme good
fortune to be with Nelson at the Nile. On that
great day, as sailing-master of the <i>Belvidera</i>, I
took the frigate around the head of Admiral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>Villeneuve’s line,&mdash;she was the leading ship,&mdash;and
placed her where she was enabled to fire
the first raking broadside of the battle. I got
a wound in the forehead which left a scar that
remains to this day; but I also received the
personal thanks of my Lord Nelson, which I
shall ever esteem as the greatest honor of my
life. I had heard nothing of Giles for nearly
a year, when, among Admiral Villeneuve’s
officers, I found one, a young lieutenant like
myself, who told me that Giles had been captured,
while on a boat expedition, and was then
in prison at Dunkerque.</p>

<p>I wrote him a dozen letters at least, by officers
who were paroled; and when the ship was paid
off, the following spring, I lost no time in
getting to London, and using what little power
I had in trying to have him exchanged. Sir
Peter was in great favor at the Admiralty.
As soon as I reached London, I went immediately
to call in Berkeley Square. My Lady
Hawkshaw was at home, and received me in
great state, black feathers and all; and with
her sat Daphne Carmichael.</p>

<p>I believe Lady Hawkshaw was really glad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>to see me; but Daphne, after speaking to me,
remained with her eyes fixed on her embroidery,
I noted, however, that she was a very charming
girl, and her eyes, under her long, dark lashes,
were full of fire and sweetness. But she had
not, and never could have, the glorious beauty
of Lady Arabella Stormont. Lady Hawkshaw
demanded of me a particular account of my
whole cruise, and everything that had happened
at the battle of the Nile. This I gave, to the
best of my ability. She then invited, or, rather,
commanded me to take up my quarters in
Berkeley Square, and told me that I had three
thousand and ten pounds, nineteen shillings and
seven-pence to my credit in bank.</p>

<p>After this, she was called upon to leave the
room for a moment, and I civilly inquired of
Daphne how Lady Arabella was.</p>

<p>“She is well,” responded Daphne, rather
tartly, I thought; “and as devoted to Captain
Overton as ever. You know Arabella ever
liked him rather more than he liked her.” At
which ungenerous speech, I said one word,
“Fie!” and Daphne, coloring to the roots of
her hair, yet attempted to defend herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“I only tell you what all the world says,
and so say my uncle and aunt. Arabella could
have married a dozen times,&mdash;she is all of
twenty-one, you know,&mdash;and married very
splendidly, but she will not. Sir Peter rages,
and swears that he will marry her off in spite
of herself; but Arabella is her own mistress
now, and laughs at Sir Peter.”</p>

<p>“And does she still play cards?”</p>

<p>Daphne raised her eyes. It seemed to give
that otherwise sweet girl positive pleasure to
call over Lady Arabella’s faults.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “Loo, lansquenet&mdash;anything
by which money can be lost or won.
Three times a week she goes to the Duchess
of Auchester’s, where play is high. We go
there to-night; but I do not play.”</p>

<p>I had not thought there was so much malice
in Daphne, until that conversation.</p>

<p>I left my adieux for Lady Hawkshaw, and
repaired to the Admiralty, where Sir Peter
happened to be, that day. I explained that I
should have come to him at once, but for my
inordinate wish to see Lady Hawkshaw; and
that I found her looking at least twenty years
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>younger since we met last. At which Sir Peter
beamed on me with delight, and, I believe,
mentally determined to give me a thousand
pounds additional, in his will.</p>

<p>I then stated my real business, which was
to get Giles Vernon exchanged; and Sir Peter,
without a moment’s hesitation, agreed to do all
he could for me; and then, as usual, directed
me to have my portmanteau sent to Berkeley
Square, as Lady Hawkshaw had done. Before
I left the Admiralty, machinery had been put in
motion to secure Giles Vernon’s exchange. I
returned to Berkeley Square, and again took up
my abode there.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII</h2></div>

<p>One month from the time I arrived in London,
I was on my way to Portsmouth to meet
Giles Vernon, who had been brought over with
a batch of exchanged officers from France.</p>

<p>In that month, during which I had lived
continuously in Berkeley Square, things were
so little changed, except in one respect, which
I shall mention presently, that I could scarcely
persuade myself five years had passed. Peter
and Polly, as Giles disrespectfully called them,
had not grown a day older, and quarreled as
vigorously as ever. Lady Arabella was then
her own mistress, although still living under
Sir Peter’s roof; but, as far as I could see,
this spoiled child of nature and fortune had
always been her own mistress. I found that
Overton had been away for some years on foreign
service, and, after distinguishing himself
greatly, had lately returned suffering from severe
wounds and injuries to his constitution.
He was, however, in London, and able to ride
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>and walk out, and visit his friends; but it
was doubted by many whether, on the expiration
of his leave, he would ever be fit for duty
again.</p>

<p>I heard and saw enough to convince me that
Lady Arabella had been wild with grief and
despair when she heard of his wounds; and,
although since his return to London he avoided
company generally, she managed to see him
occasionally, and spent much of her time driving
in the parks upon the mere chance of seeing
him taking his daily ride or walk. Lady Arabella
Stormont had everything in life that heart
could wish, except one. She had chosen to give
her wilful and wayward heart to Philip Overton,
and it must be acknowledged that he was
a man well fitted to enchain a woman’s imagination.
Overton had disdained the spontaneous
gift of Arabella’s love; but I believe her
haughty and arrogant mind could never be
brought to believe that any man could be really
insensible to her beauty, her rank, and her
fortune. Overton could not in any way be
considered a great match for her. His fortune
was modest, and his chance of succeeding to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>Vernon estates remote; but, with the desperate
perversity of her nature, him she would have
and no other. It always seemed to me as if
Overton were the one thing denied her, but that
she had determined to do battle with fate until
she conquered her soul’s desire.</p>

<p>For myself, she treated me exactly as she
had done five years before,&mdash;called me Dicky
in her good humors, and a variety of sneering
names in her bad humors,&mdash;and, little as it may
be believed, I, Richard Glyn, lieutenant in his
Majesty’s sea-service, with three thousand
pounds to my name, would have gone to the
gibbet rather than marry Lady Arabella, with
her thirty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Perhaps Daphne Carmichael had something
to do with it. She was the same gentle, winning
creature at nineteen as at twelve. She
was still Sir Peter’s pet, and Lady Hawkshaw’s
comfort; but I had not been in the house a
week before the change I alluded to came about,
and the change was in me concerning Daphne.
I began to find it very hard to keep away from
her. She treated me with great kindness before
others, but when we were alone together, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>was capricious. I began to despair of ever
finding a woman who could be kind to a man
three times running. And I was very much
surprised at the end of a fortnight to find myself
experiencing the identical symptoms I had
felt five years before, with Arabella&mdash;only
much aggravated. There was this difference,
too. I had admired Arabella as a star, afar
off, and I think I should have been very much
frightened, if, at the time, she had chosen formally
to accept my devotion. Not so with
Daphne. I felt I should never be really at ease
until I had the prospect of having her by my
side the rest of my life. I reached this phase
at the end of the third week. At the end of the
fourth, I was in a desperate case, but it was
then time to go to Portsmouth to meet Giles,
according to my promise, and I felt, when I
parted from Daphne, as if I were starting on a
three years’ cruise, and I was only to be gone a
day and a half. She, dear girl, showed some
feeling, too, and I left, bearing with me the
pack which every lover carries,&mdash;pains and
hopes.</p>

<p>I left London at night, and next morning on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>reaching Portsmouth, as I jumped from the
coach, I ran into Giles’ arms; he had reached
Portsmouth some hours in advance of the time.</p>

<p>He showed marks of his imprisonment in his
appearance, but his soul had ever been free,
and he was the same brave and joyous spirit
I had ever known. Not being minded to waste
our time in Portsmouth, we took coach for
London town at noon. As we were mounting,
a countryman standing by held up a wooden
cage full of larks, and asked us to buy, expatiating
on their beautiful song.</p>

<p>“I will take them all, my lad,” cried Giles,
throwing him a guinea. The fellow gaped for
a moment, and then made off as fast as his legs
could carry him. I wondered what Giles meant
to do with the birds. He held the cage in his
hand until we had started and were well into
the country; then, opening the little slide, he
took out one poor, fluttering bird, and, poising
on his finger for a moment, the lark flew upward
with a rush of joyous wings.</p>

<p>Each bird he liberated in the same way, all
of us on the coach-top watching him in silence.
As the last captive disappeared in the blue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>heavens, Giles, crushing the cage in his strong
hands, threw it away.</p>

<p>“I have been a prisoner for fourteen
months,” he said, “and I shall never see any
harmless living thing again imprisoned without
trying to set it free.”</p>

<p>We reached London that night, and Giles
went to his old lodgings, where his landlady
was delighted to see him, as all women were
who knew Giles Vernon. She gave us supper,
and then we sat up all night talking. I had
thought from the guinea he had thrown the
vender of larks, that he had money. I found
he had none, or next to none.</p>

<p>“And how I am to live until I get another
ship, I am at a loss, my boy,” he cried, quite
cheerfully. “Two courses are open to me&mdash;play
and running away with an heiress. Do
you know of a charming girl, Dicky, with something
under a hundred thousand pounds, who
could be reconciled to a penniless lieutenant in
his Majesty’s navy? And remember, she must
be as beautiful as the dawn besides, and of good
family, and keen of wit&mdash;no lunkhead of a
woman for me.” To this, fate impelled me to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>reply that Lady Arabella Stormont was still
single.</p>

<p>“Faith!” cried Giles, slapping his knee,
“she is the girl for me. I always intended to
marry her, if only to spite her.”</p>

<p>I was sorry I had raked up the embers of his
passion of five years before, and attempted to
cover my step by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>“She is still infatuated with Overton, whom,
however, she sees rarely, and that only at the
houses of others; but he has ever looked coldly
upon her.”</p>

<p>“She’ll not be coldly looked on by me. And
let me see; there is her cousin you used to tell
me about,&mdash;the Carmichael girl,&mdash;suppose
you, Dicky, run away with her; then no two
lieutenants in the service will have more of the
rhino than we!”</p>

<p>I declare this was the very first time I had
remembered Daphne’s thirty thousand pounds.
She had the same fortune as Lady Arabella.
The reflection damped my spirits dreadfully.</p>

<p>Giles saw it directly, and in a moment he
had my secret from me. He shouted with
delight, and immediately began a grotesque
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>planning for us to run away with the two
heiresses. He recalled that the abduction of
an heiress was a capital crime, and drew a fantastic
picture of us two standing in the prisoners’
dock, on trial for our lives, with Lady
Arabella and Daphne swearing our lives away,
and then relenting and marrying us at the gallows’
foot. And this tale, told with the greatest
glee, amid laughter and bumpers of hot brandy
and water, had a singular effect upon me. It
sobered me at once, and suddenly I seemed to
see a vision, as Macbeth saw Banquo’s ghost,
passing before my very eyes,&mdash;just such a scene
as Giles described. Only I got no farther than
the spectacle of Giles a prisoner in the dock, on
trial for his life. My own part seemed misty
and confused, but I saw, instead of the lodging-house
parlor, a great hall of justice dimly
lighted with lamps, the judges in their robes on
the bench, one with a black cap on his head, and
Giles standing up to receive sentence. I passed
into a kind of nightmare, from which I was
aroused by Giles whacking me on the back and
saying in a surprised voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>“What ails you, Dicky boy? You look as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>if you had seen a ghost. Rouse up here and
open your lantern jaws for a glass of brandy
and rid yourself of that long face.”</p>

<p>I came out of this singular state as quickly
as I had gone into it, and, ashamed to show my
weakness to Giles, grew merry, carried on the
joke about the abduction, and shortly felt like
myself, a light-hearted lieutenant of twenty-one.
I proposed that we should go to the play the
next night,&mdash;or rather that night, for it was
now about four in the morning,&mdash;and shortly
after we tumbled into bed together and slept
until late the next day.</p>

<p>Giles and I went to Berkeley Square in the
afternoon, professing just to have arrived from
Portsmouth. Giles expressed his thanks in
the handsomest manner to Sir Peter for his
kindness, and made himself, as usual, highly
agreeable to Lady Hawkshaw. Neither Lady
Arabella nor Daphne was at home, but came
in shortly after Giles had left. Lady Arabella
made some slighting remark about Giles, as
she always did whenever opportunity offered.
Daphne was very kind to me, and I gave her
to understand privately that I was ready to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>haul down my flag at the first summons to
surrender.</p>

<p>The family from Berkeley Square were going
to the play that night, and I mentioned that
Giles and I would be there together. And so,
just as the playhouse was lighting up, we
walked in. After the curtain was up, and
when Mrs. Trenchard was making her great
speech in <i>Percy</i>, I motioned Giles to look toward
Lady Hawkshaw’s box. Her ladyship entered
on Sir Peter’s arm; his face was very red, and
he was growling under his breath, to which
Lady Hawkshaw contributed an obligato accompaniment
in a sepulchral voice; and behind
them, in all the splendor of her beauty, walked
Lady Arabella, and last, came sweet, sweet
Daphne.</p>

<p>The first glimpse Giles caught of Lady Arabella
seemed to renew in an instant the spell she
had cast on him five years before. He seemed
almost like a madman. He could do nothing
but gaze at her with eyes that seemed starting
out of his head. He grew pale and then red,
and was like a man in a frenzy. It was all I
could do to moderate his voice and his looks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>in that public place. Luckily, Mrs. Trenchard
being on the stage, all eyes were, for the time,
bent on her.</p>

<p>I hardly knew how we sat the play out. I
had to promise Giles a dozen times that the
next day I would take him to Berkeley Square.
When the curtain went down, he fairly leaped
his way out of the playhouse to see Lady Arabella
get into the coach.</p>

<p>That was a fair sample of the way he raved
for days afterward. He haunted Berkeley
Square, where he was welcomed always by
Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw, asked to dine
frequently, and every mark of favor shown him.</p>

<p>Lady Arabella remained cold and indifferent
to him. About that time Overton appeared a
little in his old haunts, although much changed
and sobered. Neither wounds nor illness had
impaired his looks and charms, but rather he
had become an object of interest and sympathy
from his gallant behavior in the field. Sir
Peter, who had always liked him, began to
pester him to come to Berkeley Square, which
he did a few times, because he could not well
decline Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw’s pressing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>and friendly invitations. I believed, however,
that in spite of his forced composure he
felt cruelly abashed before Lady Arabella.
She, however, showed an amazing coolness, and
even began to be a little kind to Giles, from
some obscure motive of her own. I believe
every act of her life with regard to men had
some reference to her passion for Overton.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo7"><img src="images/i_145.jpg" width="400" alt="She suddenly fell into my arms." /></a></div>

<p class="caption no-indent">She suddenly fell into my arms.  <i>Page <a href="#Page_145">145</a></i></p>

<p>All this time, though, from the night of the
play, Daphne and I had been secretly happy;
for on the very next day, catching her alone, I
told her, in plain and seamanlike language, that
I loved her, and when she showed a disposition
to cut and run, I said to her, very boldly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Since you scorn my love, I have the resource
that every one of my calling has in these
days. I shall soon go to sea, and upon the deck
of my ship I can find death, since life is nothing
to me without my Daphne’s love.”</p>

<p>At which, without the least warning, she suddenly
fell into my arms, crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>“You’ll break my heart, if you talk in that
way!” and I perceived that she was only manœuvering
for position.</p>

<p>I do not know exactly what happened next,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>except I was in that heaven, Daphne’s arms,
when I looked up and caught the butler and
two footmen grinning at me. But it mattered
not.</p>

<p>Next morning Daphne and I met in the
drawing-room, as usual, after breakfast; but
what a meeting it was! We had barely time
to scuttle back to our chairs when Sir Peter
entered with the newspaper, and informed me
that the <i>Bellona</i> frigate was being fitted for the
West Indies, and he thought he could get me
a berth in her, at which I felt myself grow weak
in the knees, so great is the power of love.</p>

<p>Presently he went out. Then Daphne and
I began to speculate upon Sir Peter’s personal
equation in our affairs.</p>

<p>“He will never let me marry you,” she said.
“He will say I am too young.”</p>

<p>This depressed me so that I could say nothing
in reply. Daphne continued, quite in an
offhand manner,&mdash;</p>

<p>“If we should elope, he would make a great
hullabaloo.”</p>

<p>This admirable suggestion at once commended
itself to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“His hullabaloo could not separate us, if we
were married,” I replied.</p>

<p>“True,” said Daphne; “and after all, he and
Lady Hawkshaw as good as eloped, and she
was but eighteen&mdash;a year younger than I.”</p>

<p>Thus was I supplied with another argument.</p>

<p>I again swear that I had not a thought of
Daphne’s fortune in all this. I would have
taken the dear girl with nothing but the clothes
upon her back.</p>

<p>True to his word, Sir Peter worked like a
Trojan to get me a berth on the <i>Bellona</i>, and,
meaning to do Giles the greatest service in the
world, tried likewise for him; and mightily
afraid we were that he would soon succeed.</p>

<p>This brought matters to a crisis with Daphne.
I mentioned the word “elope” to her again, and
she made a great outcry, after the manner of
young women, and then began straightway to
show me precisely how it might be done, protesting,
meanwhile, that she would never, no, never,
consent. We both agreed, though, that it was
proper we should lay the matter of our marriage
before Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw;
but I saw that Daphne, who was of a romantic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>turn, had her imagination fired by the notion
of an elopement.</p>

<p>“A pair of good horses and a light traveling
chaise!” she exclaimed. “If only it were not
wrong!”</p>

<p>“No, no! Four horses!” cried I, “and
there is nothing wrong in either a two or a four
horse chaise.”</p>

<p>Daphne clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“A trip to Scotland&mdash;I have always longed
for Scotland. I know a dozen people who have
married in Scotland, and happy marriages,
every one of them. But I forbid you, Richard,
to think of an elopement.”</p>

<p>“We shall set out at midnight; we shall not
be missed until morning, and we shall have at
least twelve hours’ start. Then, at every stage,
we shall leave something behind, which will ensure
a broken axle, or a linchpin gone, for our
pursuers.”</p>

<p>We were both so charmed with the picture
we had conjured up, that when I said, “Suppose,
after all, though, that Sir Peter consents?”
Daphne’s face fell; but presently she
smiled, when I said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“If he does consent, why, then, there is no
harm in our marrying any way we like, and he
will excuse us for running away. And if he
does <i>not</i> consent, there is no help for it,&mdash;we
<i>must</i> elope!”</p>

<p>I considered myself a casuist of the first
order. I felt obliged to take the first opportunity
of letting Sir Peter know the state of
affairs, and, as usual, I determined to begin
through Lady Hawkshaw.</p>

<p>“And,” as Daphne shrewdly remarked,
“they will certainly differ, so we shall at least
have one of them on our side.”</p>

<p>I sought Lady Hawkshaw, and found her in
her usual place, in the Chinese room. I began,
halting, stammering, and blushing, as if I were
a charity school-boy, instead of a lieutenant in
his Majesty’s service, who had been thanked by
Lord Nelson.</p>

<p>“M-m-my lady,” I stuttered, “I have experienced
so much k-k-kindness from you that I
have come to you in the greatest emergency of
my life.”</p>

<p>“You want to get married,” promptly replied
Lady Hawkshaw.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>
<p>I was so staggered by having the words taken
out of my mouth, that I could only gape and
stare at her. To render my confusion worse,
she added,&mdash;</p>

<p>“And you want to marry Daphne.”</p>

<p>“I can not deny it, Madam,” I managed to
say.</p>

<p>“Will you ring the bell?” she asked.</p>

<p>I rang the bell like a churchwarden, and the
footman came, and Lady Hawkshaw immediately
sent him for Sir Peter.</p>

<p>I think my courage would wholly have given
out at that, except for a glimpse of Daphne,
flitting up the stairs. The dear girl wished to
give me heart, so she told me afterward.</p>

<p>Sir Peter appeared, and was greeted by Lady
Hawkshaw as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir Peter, here is Richard Glyn wanting to
marry Daphne. He has but three thousand
pounds; but she might go farther, and fare
worse.”</p>

<p>Sir Peter literally glared at me. He gasped
once or twice, then broke out in a torrent.</p>

<p>“He wants to marry my ward, does he&mdash;my
ward, with thirty thousand pounds, in her own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>right! I wonder, damme, he didn’t propose to
marry Arabella, too. Young gentleman, you
are too modest. Heiresses in England go about
hunting for poor lieutenants to marry. I suppose
you think it would be a fine stroke for
me to marry my ward to my nephew! Ha, ha!
Ho, ho!”</p>

<p>His laughter was demoniac.</p>

<p>“Sir Peter,” said Lady Hawkshaw severely,&mdash;for
I remained mute,&mdash;“I am astonished
at your violence and unreason. Did you never
hear of an heiress&mdash;and a fine, handsome girl,
too, with many accomplishments, and of a great
family&mdash;marrying a poor lieutenant without a
penny, and without an ancestor?”</p>

<p>“By Jupiter, I never did!” roared Sir Peter.</p>

<p>“Then, Sir Peter,” cried Lady Hawkshaw,
rising with awful dignity, “you forget all about
Lieutenant Peter Hawkshaw and the Honorable
Apollonia Jane Howard.”</p>

<p>At this, Sir Peter fairly wilted for a few
moments; and I heard something strangely
like a tittering in the next room.</p>

<p>But Sir Peter presently recovered himself in
a measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;there are lieutenants and
lieutenants, Madam, I was considered a man
likely to rise. And besides, if I remember
rightly, I was not an ill-looking fellow,
Madam.”</p>

<p>“Sir Peter, you were no taller then than you
are now&mdash;five feet four inches. Your hair
was red, and you were far from handsome.
Richard Glyn is as good-looking as you ever
were in your life; and he has already made his
mark. Richard Glyn,” turning to me, “you
are at liberty to marry Daphne Carmichael.”</p>

<p>“Richard Glyn,” bawled Sir Peter, “if you
dare to <i>think</i> you are going to marry Daphne
Carmichael,&mdash;mind, I say, if the thought ever
enters your damned head,&mdash;it will be as much
as your life is worth! I am going, this moment,
to the First Lord of the Admiralty, to
see if I can’t have you sent to the West Indies,
or the Gold Coast, with my best wishes and
endeavors to keep you there for ten years at
least.”</p>

<p>“And what will you do with <i>me</i>, dear Uncle
Peter?” suddenly asked a soft voice; and
Daphne, who had stolen into the room (she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>must have been very near), stood before him,
and nestled her pretty head against his shoulder.</p>

<p>Sir Peter was too astonished, for a moment
or two, to speak. The whole thing had fallen
upon him like the shock of an earthquake.
But in a little while he recovered his voice, and
all of his voice, too; he shouted as if he were
on the bridge of the <i>Ajax</i>, with a whole gale
blowing, and the enemy in sight.</p>

<p>“Do!” he shrieked. “What shall I do?
Bread and water, miss, for six months! Discipline,
miss!” And much more of the same
sort.</p>

<p>This roused Lady Hawkshaw to take our
part. She shouted back at Sir Peter; and I,
not to be outdone, shouted that Daphne was
mine, and I was hers, as long as life should
last; and presently Sir Peter flung out, in a
royal rage, and Lady Hawkshaw flung after
him; and Daphne sank, in tears, on my shoulder,
and I kissed her a hundred times, and
comforted her. But I knew Sir Peter was a
determined man, in some respects; and I felt
assured he would shortly carry out his threat
to send me to sea, and, once at sea, it might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>be years before I should again set foot in England.
Scotland, then, sounded sweetly in our
ears. I found, in truth, that when it came actually
to going off, Daphne’s romantic willingness
changed to a natural hesitation at so bold
a step. But the near prospect of going to the
<i>Bellona</i> turned the scale in my favor, and I
won from her a sort of oblique consent. And
another thing seemed to play directly into our
hands. Sir Peter had business at Scarborough,
which might detain him some time; and,
although it was late in the autumn, he determined
to take his family with him. I believe
it was by way of separating Daphne and me
that he came to the decision. Lady Hawkshaw
was to go, and his two wards; and they were
to remain a month. This was so obviously
showing us the road across the border, that I
told my sweet Daphne, plainly, I should carry
her off; at which she wept more, and protested
less, than I had yet seen her.</p>

<p>In the whole affair, I had counted upon the
assistance of Giles Vernon; and on the very
night the party left for Scarborough, after a
tearful farewell between Daphne and me, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>went to Giles’ lodgings, to make a clean breast
of it.</p>

<p>Giles’ voice called me up stairs; and when I
reached his room, there, spread out on the bed,
I saw a beautiful suit of brown and silver.</p>

<p>“Do you see that?” cried Giles. “That is
my wedding suit. For it I spent fifty of the
last hundred pounds I had in the world, and
it is to marry Lady Arabella Stormont that I
bought it.”</p>

<p>I thought he was crazy, but I soon perceived
there was method in his madness. He told me
seriously enough that he meant to carry off
Lady Arabella Stormont from Scarborough.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;she does not like you,” I said,
hesitating and amazed.</p>

<p>“We shall see about that, my lad,” he said,
and then began to tell me of what he thought
a great change in his favor with Arabella. He
put many trifling things which I had not noted
in such a light that under his eloquent persuasion
I began to believe Lady Arabella really
might have a secret weakness for him, which
pride prevented her from discovering. He had
never failed to win any woman’s regard yet;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>and it had always seemed a miracle to me,
Richard Glyn, who had fallen under his spell
so many years ago, how anybody could resist
him. He wound up his argument by saying, in
his usual confident manner,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Trust me, there is something compelling in
the love I feel for Arabella. Women are all
alike, my boy. They want a master. Once
put the bit in their mouths, and they adore you
for it. Let me have the spirit to run away with
that adorable creature, and see how quickly she
will come to my call. You will shortly see her
clinging to me like peaches to a southern wall.”</p>

<p>“And her fortune?”</p>

<p>“She is none the worse for that. But I
swear to you, Dicky Glyn, that I would carry
her off as the Romans did the Sabine maidens,
if she had not a shilling,”&mdash;which I believed to
be true; for his was an infatuation which takes
account of nothing.</p>

<p>He then began to tell me of his plans, and in
them he showed his usual shrewdness and boldness.
The trip to Scarborough had put Scotland
in his head. He was likely to be sent to
sea any day, to be gone, perhaps, for years;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>just the arguments I had used to myself first
and to Daphne afterward.</p>

<p>I remembered that scene five years before,
with Overton and Lady Arabella in Sir Peter’s
cubby-hole; and the memory of it made me
think with dread of Giles Vernon’s marrying
Arabella. But I could not speak openly; and,
after all, she was so strange a creature that one
could scarcely judge her by the standard of
other women. And then the plan I had to
confide to him very effectually withdrew the
charges of any battery I might have brought
to bear on him.</p>

<p>When he had finished his tale, and I had told
mine, Giles was in an ecstasy. He laughed in
his uproarious good humor.</p>

<p>“Oh, you sly dog!” he shouted. “So you
are up to the same game!”</p>

<p>I explained that I had not much to fear.
Daphne was undoubtedly fond of me, and Lady
Hawkshaw being on our side, and other reasons
in our favor,&mdash;all of which fitted Giles’ case
exactly. And at last I gave up, in sheer despair,
and agreed to Giles’ suggestion that we
should together carry off the two damsels of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>our hearts; and then and there we made our
plans, sitting up until the gray dawn came.</p>

<p>Oh, the madness of it! the wildness of it!
But we were two dare-devil and happy-go-lucky
lieutenants, without the prudence of landsmen.
We loved, and we were liable at any moment to
be torn away for many years from the idols of
our hearts. Runaway marriages were common;
and only the parents and guardians were
offended in those cases, and forgiveness generally
followed. We were about to commit a
great folly; but we thought we were nobly
sustaining the reputation of his Majesty’s sea-officers
for our spirit and gallantry with the
fair sex, and looked not to the dreadful consequences
of our desperate adventure.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII</h2></div>

<p>Giles Vernon and I agreed that it was necessary
we should strike the blow as soon as possible,
while we had the weather-gage, so to speak,
of Sir Peter; and on the day after his traveling
chariot took its way north, a very plain post-chaise
followed it, and in it were Giles Vernon
and myself.</p>

<p>Giles was in a state of the wildest happiness
conceivable. There is something appalling in
that fervor of mind when the human creature,
forgetting all the vicissitudes of this life, treads
on air and breathes and lives in Heaven. Thus I
was made sad by his gladness, but I dared not
show it, lest it be mistaken for a want of spirit
in our enterprise, so I joined with him in his joy
and revelry.</p>

<p>We reached Scarborough at four o’clock in
the afternoon, and put up at a small inn on the
outskirts of the town, and some little way on
the road to the north. We sallied forth immediately
to find out something about our inamoratas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
and Fate&mdash;whether it was that
kindly goddess who leads our footsteps toward
those we love, or whether it was the cruel Destiny
which delights in torturing men&mdash;at once
directed us. We were walking along near the
playhouse, which had been lately opened in the
town, when we saw Jeames, Lady Hawkshaw’s
own footman, go inside the playhouse and buy
some tickets of the man at the door. As soon
as he was well out of the way I sneaked in, and,
thrusting two shillings into the man’s hand,
inquired if Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw and
the young ladies would favor the performance
that night. The man grinned and showed me
a slip of paper, on which was written in Lady
Hawkshaw’s bold hand, “Three stalls for Lady
Hawkshaw and party.”</p>

<p>This made me hope that Sir Peter would not
be present, for I thought our chances of getting
off would materially improve if he were not on
the spot.</p>

<p>The play was to be over at half-past ten, and
it may be imagined that we had plenty to do
until then. We engaged four of the best pairs
of nags in the town. We arranged to pay the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>postboys according to the time they took us
over the border, and we felt in ourselves the
strength of Titans, to overcome whatever resistance
might be offered. Of course we counted
on the surprise, and we determined that the
best disposition to make of Lady Hawkshaw
was for Giles Vernon to appear suddenly, when
the people were coming out, place Lady Hawkshaw
in her coach, and then make that bold
dash for love and beauty which we had determined
upon. Our postboys, who were not new
to the perils of elopements, grinned at the prospect,
and were instructed to remain near Lady
Hawkshaw’s coach and impede it as much as
possible, so that it might be the last to reach
the door of the theater.</p>

<p>Our arrangements were complete by eight
o’clock, and from that hour until ten we employed
ourselves in disposing of a good supper
at the tavern. We were in a gale of rapture
then. It seemed to us both as if we were in
that happy and exultant mood, when the enemy
is within gun-shot and the ship is cleared for
action; and we only awaited the signal for
victory. We had some punch, but both Giles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>and myself knew enough to be exceedingly
careful in attacking it.</p>

<p>“Dicky, my lad,” cried Giles, banging me
in the back, “this day is the anniversary of the
day we whipped the <i>Indomptable</i> and the <i>Xantippe</i>!”&mdash;and
so it was. “So we shall capture
the <i>Indomptable</i>, in the Lady Arabella, and we
will disable the <i>Xantippe</i>,&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;in my
Lady Hawkshaw.”</p>

<p>This I thought a very fine joke indeed, and
we drank to it.</p>

<p>“Dicky,” began Giles again, wiping his
mouth after the punch, “I never thought I
could be constant to any woman, as I have been
to Arabella. By Heaven, the whole sex is so
seductive that it was the last one I saw I loved
the best. But since I knew that witch of a girl,
St. Anthony himself could not be more impervious
to female charms than your humble servant,”
which was true enough. “And as for
Overton,&mdash;that psalm-singing devil,&mdash;I defy
him. Give me but a week, and he shall see
Arabella hanging upon me so fondly! Let him
have her thirty thousand pounds; ’tis so much
dirt and dross to me. And she may be Lady
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>Vernon yet. Do you know that old rapscallion
Sir Thomas Vernon’s estate is in this part of
the country? though nearer York than Scarborough.
On our return from our honeymoon
I have a great mind to take my Arabella to
Vernon Court, and show her what may one day
be hers.”</p>

<p>So he raved and roared out snatches like,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent0">“In Bacchus’ joys I’ll freely roll,</div>
  <div class="verse indent0">Deny no pleasure to my soul,</div>
  <div class="verse indent0">Let Bacchus’ health round freely move;</div>
  <div class="verse indent0">For Bacchus is the friend of love&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse indent0">And he that will this toast deny,</div>
  <div class="verse indent0">Down among the dead men let him lie.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And I took up the chorus and bawled it out;
for I, too, looked for no more crosses in this life,
having Daphne for my wife.</p>

<p>So the time passed until ten o’clock; and at
ten o’clock we sallied forth.</p>

<p>It was a starlit night in early December.
The cold high blue heavens above us seemed to
radiate happiness; the myriad stars twinkled
with joy; we scarce felt the ground under our
feet.</p>

<p>The two post-chaises awaited us on the highway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
the postboys full of confidence; the horses,
the best in the town, were eager to be off. We
jumped together in one, and were whirled into
the town, and were at the door of the playhouse
almost before we knew it.</p>

<p>One of our postilions speedily found the coach
which had brought Lady Hawkshaw there, and,
in pursuance of his instructions, got the coachman
off his box to drink in a neighboring
tavern, while one of our postboys stood watch
over the horses. Giles and I remained in the
chaise until it was time for us to make our
descent.</p>

<p>At half-past ten the play was over, and then
began that hurry and commotion of the dispersion
of a crowd in the darkness. We heard
loud shouts for Lady Hawkshaw’s coach, but
the coachman did not make his appearance.
There were many officers and ladies from the
garrison, and a number of equipages; but soon
they were driving off, while half a dozen men at
once were shouting for Lady Hawkshaw’s coach.
At last my lady herself came out of the entrance,
followed by Arabella and Daphne, and
at that moment Giles slipped out of the chaise,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>and appeared before Lady Hawkshaw as if he
had risen from the earth. I, too, was on the
ground, but out of sight.</p>

<p>“Pray, my lady,” said he, in his most gallant
manner, and hat in hand, “allow me to show
you to your coach.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Vernon!” cried Lady Hawkshaw, in
surprise. “I thought you were in London.
How came you to Scarborough?”</p>

<p>“By chaise, Madam,” he replied politely;
“and I hope to see the young ladies before I
leave,” (the hypocrite!). “Is Sir Peter with
you, Madam?”</p>

<p>“No, he is not,” replied Lady Hawkshaw,
her wrath rising at the idea. “Had he been
with me, my coach would have been awaiting
me.” And then turning to Arabella and
Daphne, who were behind her, she said
sternly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Arabella and Daphne, this does not happen
again. Sir Peter comes with us to the play,
after this.”</p>

<p>I caught sight, from a corner behind the
chaise, of my dear Daphne, at that moment.
She stopped suddenly, and turned pale and then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>rosy, and glanced wildly about her. She knew
I was not far off.</p>

<p>How Arabella received Giles’ sudden appearance
I never knew, as I could not see her. But
in another moment he had placed Lady Hawkshaw,
with the utmost obsequiousness, in the
coach; then folding up the steps like magic, he
slammed the door, and shouting to the coachman,
“Drive on!” the coach rattled off, and
the next moment his arm was around Arabella,
and mine was around Daphne, and they were
swept off their feet; and in less time than it
takes to tell it, each of us was with the idol
of his heart, whirling off toward Gretna Green,
as fast as four horses to a light chaise could
take us.</p>

<p>Now, what think you, were Daphne’s first
words to me?</p>

<p>“Unhand me, Mr. Glyn, or I will scream for
assistance!”</p>

<p>“My dearest one!” I exclaimed, “you are
now mine. By to-morrow morning we shall be
over the border, and you will be my wife.”</p>

<p>“An elopement! Gracious heaven! I never
thought of such a thing!” she replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>I might have answered that she had not only
thought of such a thing, but talked of it. I
refrained, however, knowing a woman’s tongue
to be capricious in its utterances, and, instead,
assured her that my passion was such I could
no longer bear the thought of existing without
her.</p>

<p>“And do you mean to marry me, sir, without
my guardian’s consent?” she asked with
much violence.</p>

<p>“I do, indeed, my angel, and I thought it
was agreed between us.”</p>

<p>This was an unfortunate speech, and she
again threatened to scream for assistance, but
presently remarked that as there was none to
come to her assistance, she would refrain. And
then, having done what propriety required, she
began to relent a little, and at last she lay in
my arms, asking me, with tears, if I would
promise her never to love another, and I told
her, with great sincerity, that I never would,
provided I got out of that alive.</p>

<p>Deep in our own happiness,&mdash;for at least the
dear girl admitted that she was happy to be
mine,&mdash;we yet thought of Giles and Arabella,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>and I would have got out of the chaise at each
of the three stages, where we made a rapid
change of horses, except that Daphne would
not let me,&mdash;afraid, she said, lest I should be
recognized and get into trouble. She afterward
told me it was because she feared we might be
stopped. We did not forget the precaution, in
our brief halts, to pay the hostlers well to do
some harm to any pursuing vehicles which
might be after us; and our plan seemed to be
prospering famously.</p>

<p>So all night we rattled furiously along, and
at daybreak we crossed the border, notified by
the huzzaing of the postboys. It was a dank,
dismal morning, the weather having changed
during the night, and we saw that we had
passed the other chaise in the darkness. It was
some distance behind, and the horses seemed
much spent. We continued on our way, to the
house of a blacksmith at Gretna Green, who, so
our postboy told us, usually united runaway
couples. We dashed up to his cottage,&mdash;a
humble place, surrounded by a willow hedge,&mdash;and
he, warned by approaching wheels, came
out, half dressed, in the murky morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Come to be marrit?” he cried. “Step out
then.”</p>

<p>I assisted Daphne out of the chaise, and then,
as we stood on the damp ground, in those squalid
surroundings, looking at each other, the possible
wrong I had done this innocent girl suddenly
swept over me. And in her eyes, too, I read the
first consciousness of having committed an impropriety.
This dirty, unkempt blacksmith, the
coarse, laughing postboys&mdash;this, a way to
make the most solemn and spiritual of all engagements!
I felt an uncomfortable sense of
guilt and shame.</p>

<p>It was only momentary. The more depressed
she, the more should I support, and therefore
I called out cheerfully, “I take this woman to
be my wedded wife,” and such other words as I
recalled of the marriage service&mdash;and I said
it so heartily and promised so devoutly, removing
my hat when I made my vows, that it
heartened up Daphne&mdash;and her response, so
full of faith and love, gave a kind of holiness
to it all. We were two rash and foolish young
people&mdash;but we loved each other truly, and we
made our vows solemnly, determined to keep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>them. Perhaps that counts for more, in the
eyes of God, than all else; at least, we realized
the sacredness of our vows.</p>

<p>Scarcely was the brief ceremony over&mdash;for
ceremony we made it&mdash;when the chaise containing
Arabella and Giles drew up. And the sight
I saw, I can never forget.</p>

<p>Arabella’s face was quite pale, but her eyes
were blazing. There were some drops of blood
upon her cheek&mdash;they came from her wrists,
which Giles held firmly. The door of the chaise
being opened, she stepped out willingly, disdaining
the assistance Giles offered her. His face,
too, was very pale, and he looked and moved like
a man in a nightmare. The blacksmith grinned
broadly; he thought his gains were to be increased&mdash;for
I had not forgotten to pay him
handsomely.</p>

<p>Giles seized her hand. “Arabella,” he cried
desperately, “surely you do not now mean to
throw me over?”</p>

<p>For answer, she gave him a glance of ineffable
hatred.</p>

<p>“This man,” she said, turning to me, “your
friend, your intimate&mdash;I blush for you&mdash;has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>dragged me here. Rather would I die than
marry him. Look!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo8"><img src="images/i_171.jpg" width="400" alt="Rather would I die than marry him." /></a></div>

<p class="caption no-indent">“Rather would I die than marry him.”  <i>Page <a href="#Page_171">171</a></i></p>

<p>She held up her wrists, and they showed
marks of violence.</p>

<p>“’Twas to keep her from jumping out of the
chaise,” said Giles wildly. “She would have
had me leave her at midnight, on the highway&mdash;alone
and unprotected. Dearest Arabella,”
he cried, turning to her, and trying to clasp her,
“will you not listen to my prayer? How can
you scorn such love as mine?” And he was
near going down on his knees to her, in the mud&mdash;but
I held him up. I confess that the most
painful thing, of all this painful business, was
Giles Vernon’s complete surrender of his manhood,
under the influence of his wild passion.
He, an officer in his Majesty’s sea-service, a
man who had smelt powder and knew what it
was to look Death in the eye and advance upon
him, who would have answered with his life for
his courage, was ready to grovel in the earth
like a madman for the favor of a woman.
Nothing was it to him that low-born creatures
like the postboys and the blacksmith beheld him
with contempt and disgust; nothing to him that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>a woman like Daphne, and that I, a brother
officer, witnessed his degradation. He seemed
to have parted with the last semblance of self-respect.</p>

<p>Arabella answered his appeal by a laugh of
scorn, which seemed to cut him like a knife;
and then, shaking me off, he shouted to her,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I know why you will not be mine. It is
that pious, hypocritical hound, Overton. But I
tell you now, my lady, if you marry him, I’ll
have his life. Take note of what I say&mdash;I’ll
have his life.”</p>

<p>To which Arabella, after a pause in which her
face grew deeply red and then pale again,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your own life is in jeopardy. The abduction
of an heiress is a capital offense, and you
shall be tried for your life if it takes every shilling
of my fortune to do it. You shall see what
you have done!”</p>

<p>I shuddered at these words, for I saw it was
no idle threat. If Giles contemplated violence
toward Overton, I had not the slightest doubt
that Arabella was fully capable of keeping her
word in the dreadful business. Daphne thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>so too; for she ran forward, and, putting her
hands over Arabella’s mouth, cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>“No, no! dear Arabella, take that back!”</p>

<p>“But I will not take it back,” replied Arabella;
“and I shall lodge information against
this wretch, as soon as I can return to Scarborough,&mdash;which
I shall do in the post-chaise;
for, luckily, I have money with me.”</p>

<p>Under the terrible threat of prosecution, Giles
recovered himself surprisingly. He lost his
frantic air, and, drawing himself up, remarked
quite calmly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Just as your ladyship pleases.”</p>

<p>His change of manner seemed to infuriate
Arabella, who shrieked at him,&mdash;</p>

<p>“You shall be hanged for this!”</p>

<p>“Anything to oblige your ladyship,” responded
Giles, as cool as you please.</p>

<p>I felt that this painful scene could no longer
continue, and said so.</p>

<p>“Lady Arabella,” said I, “my wife”&mdash;how
Daphne’s eyes glowed as I spoke&mdash;“and I are
returning immediately to Scarborough; you had
best go with us; and when you have seen and
consulted with Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>it will be time enough to determine upon your
course.”</p>

<p>“My course is already determined upon,” she
replied; and no one who saw her could doubt it.</p>

<p>“And so is mine,” said Giles, now in possession
of all his usual manliness. “I return to
London, where I shall duly report myself to the
Admiralty, and later to Sir Peter Hawkshaw;
and if the lady thirsts for my blood, begad, she
can have it.”</p>

<p>“Giles Vernon,” said I, “you have been unlucky.
I can not say more, because I am in the
same boat with you. But you have done nothing
unworthy of a gentleman, and nothing to
make either Daphne or me love you the less, no
matter what befalls. So here is my hand upon
it.”</p>

<p>We grasped hands, and, turning to Daphne,
he removed his hat and proceeded to kiss her,
saying to me, “By your leave.” And Daphne
said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good-by, dear Giles.”</p>

<p>The proceedings seemed to fill Lady Arabella
with disgust. She haughtily refused my hand
to assist her into the chaise, and announced that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>she would go to the village of Springfield, near
by, for rest and breakfast; and willy-nilly,
Daphne and I had to follow in the post-chaise.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget that dismal wedding
journey back to Scarborough. I began, for
the first time, to fear the reproaches of the world
in general, and Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw
in particular, in regard to running away with
an heiress. I had one comfort, however;
Daphne fully believed in my disinterestedness;
and I can sincerely say I wished Daphne’s fortune
at the bottom of the sea, if I could but
have wooed and won her in the ordinary course
of events.</p>

<p>Lady Arabella traveled just ahead of us, but
took occasion to show her anger and resentment
against us in every way.</p>

<p>About half the distance to Scarborough we
met full in the road a traveling chariot, and in
it were Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw.</p>

<p>We found that the hostlers had earned their
money, and that the Hawkshaws’ chaise had
broken down at least once in every stage.</p>

<p>When we met and stopped, Arabella
alighted, and so did we, and so did the Hawkshaws;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
and the first word that was spoken was
by Daphne.</p>

<p>“Uncle Peter,” she said, “don’t fly at Richard.
If you must know it, I ran away with
him; for I am sure, although he is as brave as
a lion, it never would have dawned upon him to
run away with me, if I had not put the idea in
his head, and kept it there.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said I, “and Madam,” turning to
Lady Hawkshaw, “I beg you will not listen to
this young lady’s plea. I am wholly responsible
for the circumstances of our marriage. I
can, however, and do, call Heaven to witness,
that her fortune had nothing to do with it, and
I should have been happy and proud to take
her, with the clothes on her back, and nothing
more.”</p>

<p>Sir Peter began to sputter, but Lady Hawkshaw
cut him short.</p>

<p>“Exactly what you said, Sir Peter, within
an hour of our marriage.”</p>

<p>Thus were Sir Peter’s guns dismounted.</p>

<p>“And, Richard and Daphne, you are a couple
of fools to run away, when, if you had only
had a little patience, I would have had you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>handsomely married at St. George’s, Hanover
Square. But least said, soonest mended. Sir
Peter, kiss Daphne, and shake hands with Richard.”</p>

<p>And as I am a sinner, she actually forced Sir
Peter to do both, although I saw he mortally
hated it.</p>

<p>Arabella’s turn came next. She advanced
and said, with a bitterness that struck a chill to
my heart,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir Peter, as you know, I was carried off
by that wretch who disgraces his uniform, Lieutenant
Giles Vernon; but he did not succeed in
forcing me to consent to a marriage. And I
call upon you, as my next friend, to aid me in
the prosecution which I shall immediately set on
foot against him for the capital offense of the
abduction of an heiress; and I hope to bring
him to the gibbet for it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX</h2></div>

<p>Lady Arabella Stormont was as good as
her word; for that day, two months, Giles Vernon
was put on trial for his life, at York
Assizes, for the abduction of an heiress. Sir
Peter Hawkshaw refused absolutely to countenance
Arabella; and my Lady Hawkshaw, who
never had bowed her head or abased her spirit to
mortal man or mortal woman before, went upon
her knees, imploring Arabella to give over her
revenge,&mdash;for revenge it was, pure and simple,&mdash;but
Lady Arabella laughed at her. Lady
Hawkshaw rose from her knees, crying out,&mdash;</p>

<p>“You have some deep and unknown reason
for this; but it will come to naught, it will
come to naught!”</p>

<p>But Arabella found a person ready to her
hand, who was most active in the matter. This
was Sir Thomas Vernon, of Vernon Court. It
was he who lodged the information with the
public prosecutor against Giles, and assumed
the part of Lady Arabella’s champion. Of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>course, there was some ground for the version
of the story which was started in Arabella’s interest,
that a frightful outrage had been committed
by dragging her off against her will;
and that only the most determined courage had
saved her from a marriage repulsive to her; that
Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw, her next
friends, had basely deserted her; and that Sir
Thomas had chivalrously taken up her cause.
It is true that the relative characters of the
Hawkshaws and Sir Thomas Vernon discounted
much of this; but the actual facts in the case
looked so ugly for Giles, that there was no
trouble in securing his prompt arrest and delivery
in York jail.</p>

<p>The breach between Lady Arabella and the
Hawkshaws, as well as Daphne and myself, was
too great to be bridged over; and, having
thrown herself, so to speak, in Sir Thomas Vernon’s
arms, she accepted the protection of a
relative of his, one Mrs. Whitall, a decayed gentlewoman,
and went to live at a small town near
York, until the Assizes, when she would be called
upon as the chief witness for the prosecution.
Great stories were immediately put forth, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>Sir Thomas Vernon was deeply smitten with
Arabella’s charms, and that, after a visit with
Mrs. Whitall to Vernon Court, she looked very
kindly on Sir Thomas. All this might be true,
and Sir Thomas might flatter himself that he
had won her favor; but, knowing Arabella well,
I did not credit her with any sincere desire to be
kind to Sir Thomas Vernon, although she might
make him think so, for her own purposes. I
suspected, however, a motive far deeper, in any
matter connected with Sir Thomas Vernon.
Overton was the next heir after Giles; Sir
Thomas was extremely rickety, and not likely to
be long-lived; and if, by merely telling what
had happened, Lady Arabella could sate her resentment,
which was deep and furious, against
Giles, and at the same time greatly benefit Overton,
I think she would not have weighed Giles’
life at a penny. My Daphne, whose faith in
human nature was angelic, in her belief in ultimate
good, prayed and besought Arabella to
leave the country before the trial came off; but
Arabella only said contemptuously:</p>

<p>“You are a child and a chit. Giles Vernon
contemplated doing me the greatest wrong a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>man can do a woman. Do you think I shall let
him go unpunished? If so, how little do you
know Arabella Stormont!”</p>

<p>Then I, from loyalty to Giles, and not from
any hope I had from Lady Arabella, went to
her and made my appeal. She heard all my
prayers without the slightest sign of relenting,
playing with her lap-dog the while. At last, I
said to her,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tell me, at least, who is to be benefited by
the conviction of Giles Vernon? Not you, certainly;
for you will be loathed and shunned by
all.”</p>

<p>“The person dearest to me in the world,” she
replied; “the person I love better than my life
or my soul,” and then, as if she had admitted
too much, she stopped, turned pale, and seemed
altogether disconcerted. She had, in truth, admitted
too much. The person she had ever
loved better than her soul was Philip Overton.</p>

<p>I had the self-possession to leave her then,
and went off by myself to think over the strange
motive which had been revealed to me. Arabella’s
infatuation for Overton had always been
abnormal, touched with unreason. And could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>fate have woven a closer web around Giles Vernon
than in making him fall so madly in love
with Arabella Stormont?</p>

<p>Giles had promptly surrendered himself,
rightly judging a trial better than being a
fugitive from justice and a deserter from the
naval service. He repaired to York, after having
duly reported to the Admiralty, and was
jailed immediately, and indicted.</p>

<p>The Hawkshaws, my Daphne, and I remained
in Scarborough during the two dreadful months
that passed before the trial came off. Sir Peter
easily got leave from the Admiralty for me,
hoping, not only that my testimony, but the
example of the felicity in which Daphne and I
lived, might not be without its effect upon the
jury that tried Giles.</p>

<p>Offers of money to assist in his defense came
from many quarters and from several ladies,&mdash;two
in especial, her Grace of Auchester and
Mrs. Trenchard. Lady Hawkshaw, however,
claimed the privilege of bearing the expenses
of the trial out of her private fortune, which
was large. Sir Peter and she had it hot and
heavy, he desiring to contribute; and for one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>of the few times in his life, he carried his point
against her. Two great barristers were to be
brought from London to assist Giles in his defense,
besides another one in York itself.</p>

<p>As soon as Giles was lodged in jail, Sir Peter
and Lady Hawkshaw, Daphne and I went immediately
to see him. We drove in state, in
a coach and four, with outriders, Sir Peter in
his uniform, with his sword, and I also in uniform;
for our object was to testify publicly our
regard for Giles and detestation of the prosecution
for his life which was on foot.</p>

<p>We reached the great gloomy building, and
the turnkey immediately showed us to Giles’
room. It was one of the best rooms in the
place, and would have been comfortable enough
had it not been in a prison.</p>

<p>He was delighted to see us, kissed Lady
Hawkshaw’s hand, and gave Daphne a hearty
smack on the cheek. He looked well, and I expected
to find him hopeful; but he seemed to
regard his fate as fixed, although it in no wise
disturbed his cheerfulness. Sir Peter at once
told him that everything possible should be
done for his defense, and that eminent counsel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>were then on their way from London for him;
and he with Lady Hawkshaw would bear all the
costs of the trial.</p>

<p>“And we,” cried Daphne, “claim the right to
help; and when you are acquitted, you will find
all your debts paid, and need not trouble yourself
where the money comes from.”</p>

<p>Tears sprang to Giles’ eyes at this, and he
looked gratefully upon us all.</p>

<p>“Dear friends,” he said, “I thank you; but
I shall not be acquitted. Sir Thomas Vernon
and Lady Arabella Stormont thirst for my
blood, and by my own folly I have put the noose
around my neck. But I say to you from the
bottom of my heart that I rather would die
upon the gibbet than be married to Lady Arabella.
God was good to me in giving her to me
as my enemy instead of my wife.”</p>

<p>There was something in this; for what man
could think, without shuddering, of taking Arabella
Stormont to wife?</p>

<p>I saw that Giles had completely recovered
from his madness. He blamed no one, frankly
acknowledging his own folly, and bore himself
as became an officer and a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>Sir Peter would by no means admit there was
the smallest chance of an adverse verdict; but
although I could not bring myself to believe
that the extreme penalty of the law would be
carried out, yet I thought it very likely that
the case was too plain for Giles to escape conviction.
The conduct of Daphne and Lady
Hawkshaw to him was such that I came out of
the jail with a deeper reverence, a higher esteem
for women than I had known before, although
I had always believed them to be God’s
angels on earth (with a few exceptions). So
gentle and caressing was Daphne, so boldly and
determinedly friendly was Lady Hawkshaw,
that it did one’s heart good. Daphne announced
her intention of going to see Sir
Thomas Vernon and pleading with him, while
Lady Hawkshaw threatened to give him her
opinion of him publicly, which was, indeed, a
dreadful threat.</p>

<p>The trial came off at the February Assizes,
and on the night before was the great assize
ball. The word was passed around that all of
Giles Vernon’s friends were to attend this ball,
by way of showing our confidence&mdash;alas!&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>his acquittal. Therefore, on that night, we&mdash;that
is, the Hawkshaws, Daphne, and I&mdash;were
to go to the ball in all the state we could muster.
We had taken lodgings at York for the trial.</p>

<p>The evening of the ball found the streets
crowded as I had never seen them before. The
great case, which would be reached within a day
or two, brought crowds to attend the Assizes,
many persons coming even from London.
These were chiefly gentlemen of the nobility and
gentry who were friends of Giles Vernon’s, for
never man had so many friends.</p>

<p>It was a cold bright February night; and the
street in front of the assize hall where the ball
was held was packed with chariots, chaises, and
people on foot, flaring torches and bawling footmen,
as if it were a London rout. As our carriage
passed the entrance, the way was blocked
by the judges’ chariots, from which they descended
in state. Our coachman, whipping up
to get the next place in line, locked wheels with
the coach of Sir Thomas Vernon. He sat back,
his face visible by the lamps in the courtyard,
and as unconcerned as if the case which had
brought us all to York was one of his servants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>beating the watch, instead of the trial of his
relative and heir on a capital charge.</p>

<p>The crowd showed its disapproval of Sir
Thomas by hurling abusive epithets at him,
which only caused him to smile. But he had
another enemy to encounter, which was Lady
Hawkshaw, and in full sight and hearing of the
judges, as they stepped with stately tread up the
stairs, occurred a battle <i>a mort</i> between her and
Sir Thomas Vernon, to the intense enjoyment of
the crowd, which was uproariously on Lady
Hawkshaw’s side. Neither Sir Peter nor I took
any part in the fray, seeing Lady Hawkshaw
had the best of it from the start, and that,
woman against man, the populace was heartily
with her.</p>

<p>It began by Lady Hawkshaw’s putting her
head out of the coach and saying at the top of
her voice,&mdash;and what a voice!&mdash;“Good evening,
Sir Thomas. We are called here upon a
sad occasion, but I hope that English justice
will prevail to save the life of that gallant
young man, your heir, Giles Vernon.”</p>

<p>To which Sir Thomas, with a wicked grin,
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>“We may safely leave that to the jury and
to their honors, the lords justices, Madam. But
if a young villain steals an heiress against her
will, he incurs the extreme penalty of the law.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Lady Hawkshaw, “I dare say
you think the law will deal by Giles Vernon as
it did by poor Jack Bassett, whom you got
transported for life for killing a hare which was
already half dead; or as it served Tobias Clark,
the blacksmith, whom you got hanged for stealing
one of your sheep.”</p>

<p>These things were true, and the crowd gave
three loud groans for Sir Thomas Vernon. Before
he could get his breath to reply, Lady
Hawkshaw continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>“No wonder you are afraid to sleep without
candles burning in your room all night. Sir
Thomas.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas ground his teeth, and called,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Back your horses, coachman, and drive
out.”</p>

<p>But the crowd would by no means permit
it, holding on to the wheels, and shouts resounded
of “Good for your ladyship! Hawkshaw
for ever!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>Sir Peter lay back laughing, while Daphne,
by way of encouraging the people, clapped her
hands and kissed Lady Hawkshaw on the cheek.</p>

<p>“And let me tell you, Sir Thomas,” continued
that excellent and indomitable woman,
“that because no woman could ever be induced
to elope with <i>you</i>, there is no reason why runaway
marriages should not be the happiest in
the world. I defied my family and as good as
ran away with Sir Peter Hawkshaw, and he was
as poor as Giles Vernon; but, like him, he was
a true and gallant gentleman, and God bless the
day I married him!”</p>

<p>At this there was tremendous cheering for Sir
Peter, and he took off his hat and bowed, kissing
Lady Hawkshaw’s hand.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas responded by calling out airily,&mdash;</p>

<p>“May I ask your ladyship if Sir Peter was
a free agent in the affair of your marriage?
for I believe he is not generally held accountable
for his actions since that day.”</p>

<p>Sir Peter’s eyes flashed at that, but Lady
Hawkshaw cried back,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Right you are, Sir Thomas, for have him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>I would, and if he had not agreed to marry me
I should have died of disappointment. Nor has
he been a free agent since that day,&mdash;not for
one moment free from my love, my admiration,
and my solicitude. I knew you well, Sir
Thomas, forty years ago” (this was a cruel
thrust, for Sir Thomas was notoriously touchy
about his age), “and I would no more have
run away with <i>you</i> then than I would this night&mdash;and
God knows no woman in all the three
kingdoms would go with you now!”</p>

<p>The delight of the crowd was extraordinary.
I believe they would have mobbed Sir Thomas,
except that they felt that Lady Hawkshaw
could inflict the more exquisite misery on him.
The judges, still going up the steps slowly,
probably heard every word of this controversy.
The crowd then parted, and taking Sir Thomas’
horses by the bits, forced them to give place to
Lady Hawkshaw’s coach, and she descended
amid the loudest cheers of the populace.</p>

<p>Within the splendid ball-room Lady Hawkshaw’s
triumph was even more marked. Numbers
of great people flocked around her; many
of them had been witnesses of her battle royal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>with Sir Thomas, and the story had quickly
spread to the rest. Lady Hawkshaw, in spite
of her oddities, had always maintained the respect
of all who knew her, and never saw I a
woman who bore, under all circumstances, more
unmistakably the air of a great lady; whether
squabbling with Sir Peter, laying down the law
to the world at large, or speaking bad French,
she was invariably the woman of quality.</p>

<p>The scene of the ball was so gorgeous that
even my sad heart took note of it. The hall
was ablaze with wax lights, and a huge band of
musicians brayed and trumpeted. The lords
justices, the lords lieutenants of the three Ridings,
and many other persons were in full court
costumes, and the ladies’ trains of brocade and
velvet were a sight to see. And I may be pardoned
for saying that Mistress Richard Glyn
was by no means the least handsome of the
women present.</p>

<p>By Lady Hawkshaw’s command we were all
to look cheerful, and, when I saw the outpouring
of popular approval upon us as Giles Vernon’s
next friends, my heart grew less heavy.</p>

<p>Lady Hawkshaw seated herself in a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>chair at the end of the hall, where she held a
kind of court. She wore a gown of some sort
of crimson stuff, with a great tail to it, and on
her head was a turban with a bird of paradise
in it, and on top of that, her huge diamond
tiara. Everybody flocked to pay her court, and
the lord lieutenant of the East Riding asked
the honor of her hand to open the ball. She
promptly agreed, with the added remark that
she had not danced for thirty years. Sir Peter
attempted to interpose.</p>

<p>“You can not do it, my lady,” he said.
“You will trip up and break your leg.”</p>

<p>“Not unless you trip me up, Sir Peter,”
responded her ladyship, who was totally unable
to keep up the turtle-dove style toward Sir Peter
for any appreciable length of time. “My legs
are as good as the lord lieutenant’s, thank God!
and I shall have the pleasure in dancing with his
lordship.”</p>

<p>Obeying a look from her, Daphne accepted
a partner, and I secured one in the lord mayor’s
daughter. Sir Thomas Vernon, who was then
in the hall, had the ineffable impudence to wish
to dance in the country dance with us, but he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>was met everywhere with cold looks and refusals.
The ladies of the lords lieutenants were
all engaged; so were their daughters. It was a
picture to see him going along the line of ladies
sitting against the wall, being repulsed by all,
and his composure under these embarrassing circumstances
was the most extraordinary thing I
ever saw. He wore a smile upon his sickly, but
handsome face all the time, and, at last, he
found a partner in the person of a monstrous
ugly woman, whose husband was in the hides
and leather trade.</p>

<p>We took our places, Lady Hawkshaw and the
lord lieutenant, a fine, handsome man, many
years younger than she, at the head of the room.
And then the musicians struck up, and Lady
Hawkshaw began to dance.</p>

<p>Such dancing! It was of the kind that was
fashionable before the American war, and introduced
so many cuts, capers, pigeon-wings, slips,
slides, and pirouettes, that it was really an art
in itself. And her agility was surprising.
With her train over her arm, her tiara blazing,
and her bird of paradise nodding violently,
Lady Hawkshaw’s small high-bred feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>twinkled. She was a large woman, too, and she
proved that her boast about her legs was well
founded. When she came face to face with Sir
Thomas Vernon in the dance, instead of turning
him, she folded her arms and sailed around
him, carefully avoiding touching his hand.
And he, the old sinner, being acquainted with
that ancient style of dancing, made a caper so
exactly like her ladyship’s, with so grave a
countenance, that the whole ball-room was in a
titter. But although the people might laugh
at Sir Thomas’ excellent mimicry, the sentiment
was totally against him, and he found difficulty
in getting gentlemen to notice him, or ladies to
dance with him. With Lady Hawkshaw, on the
contrary, it was every man’s desire to dance;
she was besieged with partners, young and old;
but having shown what she could do, she rested
upon her laurels, and sat in state the rest of the
evening, fanning herself with vast dignity and
composure, and occasionally snapping at Sir
Peter, who, it must be admitted, made no great
figure at a ball.</p>

<p>At last it was over, and we returned to our
lodgings. The next day but one we were on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>our way to the assize hall for the trial of Giles
Vernon.</p>

<p>A tremendous crowd was present, and there
was difficulty in gaining an entrance; some one,
however, in the multitude set up a shout of
“Way for Lady Hawkshaw!” and the people
fell back, leaving us a clear path to the door,
and into the hall itself.</p>

<p>Within that place of judgment all was dignity
and decorum. The lords justices in their
robes and wigs sat like statues; and, presently,
when we were all seated and the crier had pronounced
the court open, Giles Vernon was
brought in, and placed in the prisoners’ dock.
He looked pale from his late confinement, but
I thought I had never seen his plain features
so nearly handsome. His fine figure was nobly
set off by the identical brown and silver suit
which the poor fellow had bought for his wedding
with Lady Arabella, and, in a flash, came
back to me that strange vision I had had at
his London lodgings on the night that this unfortunate
elopement was first talked of between
us. My heart stood still, and I grew sick and
faint at the recollection of the rest of that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>dream, or revelation, or whatever it was.</p>

<p>Giles, meanwhile, had bowed respectfully to
the judges, then to the assembled people, who
very generally returned his salutation with
every mark of politeness. Turning to where
we sat, he bowed and smiled. We all rose, and
Lady Hawkshaw and Daphne made him deep
curtseys. A jury was soon selected and sworn,
and the first witness called was Lady Arabella
Stormont.</p>

<p>In a moment she entered, leaning upon the
arm of Sir Thomas Vernon, and was by him
escorted to her place in the witness-box.</p>

<p>Her beauty was almost unearthly. She wore
a black gown and a simple white cap, under
which the curls of her rich hair shone like burnished
gold. She was perfectly composed, and,
after being sworn, began her story in a manner
the most quiet and calm. A deep stillness
reigned through the vast room, and every one
in it caught her lowest word.</p>

<p>Her testimony was entirely clear and straightforward.
She related the circumstances of her
being dragged off, while coming out of the
playhouse at Scarborough; of finding herself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>alone in the chaise with Giles Vernon, who told
her he was taking her to Scotland to marry her;
that she struggled violently and endeavored to
get out of the chaise, and that she was withheld
by force by Giles, who severely hurt her wrists,
causing blood to flow; and finally, that when she
began to scream, Giles put his hand over her
mouth and stifled her cries. She said that this
conduct was kept up the whole of the night,
until they reached Gretna Green at daylight;
that all the time Giles was imploring her to
marry him, then threatening to kill himself or
her; and that she told him many times she preferred
death to marriage with him; and at last,
on reaching Gretna Green, she defied him and
escaped from him.</p>

<p>When she had concluded, there was an ominous
stillness for a time, and then I saw something
which struck a chill to my heart. I had
stealthily kept my eyes fixed on the judges to
see whether they gave in their countenances
any signs of lenity or severity. They were altogether
unmoved, except one, who was reported
to be a most merciful man. He grew pale and
paler as Lady Arabella’s story progressed, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>I saw him several times wipe the cold sweat from
his brow, and at last a sigh broke from him;
but I think no one noted it but me, for the multitude
of people were absorbed in the sight of
this beautiful young woman, so coolly swearing
away the life of a man who had loved her.</p>

<p>Giles Vernon bore the ordeal unflinchingly,
and when at intervals she looked toward him
with a quiet hatred in her glance, he gazed
steadily back at her.</p>

<p>She was then to be cross-examined. Many
questions were asked her by the great London
barrister, who was one of the three defending
Giles. One query was, whether she had ever
given Mr. Vernon reason to think she would
marry him, to which she replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>“No; never in my life.”</p>

<p>She was then asked if there was another gentleman
in the case, and for the first time she
showed confusion. Her face grew crimson, and
she remained silent. The question was not
pressed, and she was soon permitted to retire.
When she passed out of the hall, she was the
divinest picture of beauty and modesty I ever
saw. Her eyes sought the floor, and a delicious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>blush mantled her cheek. I believe that many
persons, under the spell of her beauty, thought
that she was an unwilling witness, and pitied
her youth and inexperience.</p>

<p>But it was hanging testimony she gave, and
well she knew it.</p>

<p>After the examination of the postboys and
other witnesses for the prosecution, I was called
as the first witness for Giles. I told the circumstances
of our agreement to run away with the
two charmers of our hearts; and the fact that I
had been so readily forgiven, not only by
Daphne herself, but by Sir Peter and Lady
Hawkshaw, I saw produced a good effect. But
when I was asked by the other side if I had ever
seen, or if Giles had ever claimed, any willingness
on Lady Arabella’s part to go off with him,
I broke down miserably. My testimony did
Giles but little good, I fear.</p>

<p>Sir Peter Hawkshaw was the next witness.
It was plain from the start that he desired to
help Giles, and likewise that he knew very little
of the affair until it was all over. But he
proved a most entertaining, if discursive witness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Sir Peter evidently thought the witness-box
was his own quarter-deck, and he proceeded to
harangue the court in his best manner as a flag
officer. He talked of everything except the
case; he gave a most animated description of
the fight between the <i>Ajax</i> on our side and the
<i>Indomptable</i> and <i>Xantippe</i> on the other, praising
Giles Vernon’s gallantry at every turn. He
also aired his views on the subject of the flannel
shirts furnished to the navy, alleging that some
rascally contractors ought to be hanged at the
yard-arm for the quality supplied; and wound
up by declaring, with great gusto, that if an
officer in his Majesty’s service desired to
marry a young lady, it was an act of spirit
to carry her off, and for his part, fellows
of that sort were the kind he should select
to lead a boarding party, while the sneaking,
law-abiding fellows should be under the
hatches when the ship was cleared for action.</p>

<p>Sir Peter’s rambling but vigorous talk was
not without its effect, upon which I think he had
shrewdly calculated. In vain counsel for the
crown tried to check him; Sir Peter bawled at
them to pipe down, and remarked aloud of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>senior counsel who had been most active in trying
to suppress him,&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo9"><img src="images/i_201.jpg" width="400" alt="That lawyer fellow is three sheets in the wind!" /></a></div>

<p class="caption no-indent">“That lawyer fellow is three sheets in the wind!” <i>Page <a href="#Page_201">201</a></i></p>

<p>“That lawyer fellow is three sheets in the
wind, with the other one a-flapping!”</p>

<p>The judges, out of respect to him, made no
great effort to subdue him, and he had the satisfaction
of telling his story his own way.
When the prosecution took him in hand, they
found, though, that he could very well keep to
the subject-matter, and they did not succeed in
getting anything of the slightest consequence
out of him. When he stepped down, I saw that
he had in reality done much more good to Giles’
cause than I had, although he knew little about
the facts, and I knew all.</p>

<p>Then came Lady Hawkshaw’s testimony.
Sir Peter’s was not a patch on it. Like him,
she really had no material evidence to give, but,
with a shrewdness equal to his, she made a very
good plea for the prisoner. She began with a
circumstantial account of her own marriage to
Sir Peter, in which the opposition of her family
was painted in lurid hues. In vain was she
again and again checked; she managed to tell
her tale against the vigorous objections of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>prosecutors, and the somewhat feeble and perfunctory
rebukes from the bench. The jury,
however, were plainly so interested in it, that no
serious attempt was made to stop her&mdash;not
that it would have availed anything, for Lady
Hawkshaw was not used to stopping for any
one.</p>

<p>“No doubt my family could have hounded
Sir Peter for marrying me,” she announced in
the beginning, “but my family, your honors, is
an honorable one, and would not condescend to
nasty tricks like&mdash;” Here she fixed her great
black eyes on Sir Thomas Vernon, who smiled
blandly and took snuff.</p>

<p>“And as for a man expecting opposition in a
girl he is willing to marry, I ask your honors,
does a man exist who can believe, until it is
proved to him beyond cavil, that there is a
woman alive who would not jump for joy to
marry him?”</p>

<p>This produced so much laughter that the
bailiffs had to enforce order in the hall.</p>

<p>Lady Hawkshaw then, with great ingenuity,
referred to Sir Thomas Vernon, “who, in those
days, forty years ago, was not called ‘Wicked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>Sir Thomas,’ but plain ‘Lying Tom Vernon’!”</p>

<p>This produced a regular uproar, during which
Lady Hawkshaw, with great complacency,
fanned herself. After a warning from the presiding
justice to keep to the matter in hand, she
curtsied deeply to him, and immediately resumed
her account of Sir Thomas Vernon, in
which she told of a certain occasion, in the time
of the American war, when, as the royal family
was passing to chapel at Windsor, hisses were
heard, which were directly traced to Sir Thomas
Vernon, the king having declined to receive him
at the levee on account of his notoriously bad
character. And Sir Thomas, being thrust out,
was taken by some of the inhabitants of Windsor,
and ducked in a neighboring horse-pond.
At this point, the judge himself courteously but
firmly interrupted Lady Hawkshaw, and informed
her that she could not be permitted to go
on in that strain.</p>

<p>“I shall observe your lordship’s caution,” she
replied politely, and straightway launched into
a description of Sir Thomas’ appearance when
he emerged from the horse-pond, which brought
a smile to every face in court&mdash;including even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>the judge’s&mdash;except the victim himself, who
bit his lip, and scowled in fury.</p>

<p>The judges afterward said that Lady Hawkshaw
proved to be the most unmanageable witness
any and all of them had ever encountered;
for in spite of them, she gave a circumstantial
account of every misdeed Sir Thomas Vernon
had ever been guilty of in his life, as far as she
knew.</p>

<p>The crown lawyers, very wisely, declined to
cross-examine this witness. When she stepped
down out of the witness-box and took Sir Peter’s
arm, she passed close to the presiding justice,
who happened to have his snuff-box open in his
hand. My lady deliberately stopped and took
a pinch out of the judge’s box, remarking
suavely,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your lordship shows excellent taste in preferring
the Spanish!”</p>

<p>I thought his lordship would drop out of his
chair.</p>

<p>The evidence being all in, and the arguments
made, a recess was taken. We were not the
only ones who paid our respects immediately to
Giles Vernon. Many persons went forward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>and shook his hand, while I think Sir Thomas
did not receive a cordial greeting from a single
man or woman in the hall, although he was
known to every one present.</p>

<p>We got a hurried dinner at the tavern, and
returned at once to the hall. It was about half-past
four in the winter afternoon, and the day
being dark and lowering, candles were required.
The lord justice’s instructions to the jury were
then read, and my heart sank, as, in a dreadful
monotone, he expounded the law to them. Alas!
As long as the statute against the abduction of
an heiress remained, Giles Vernon was guilty of
a capital crime; and not one word uttered by
any one of us who testified in his behalf did
aught but prove the more strongly that he had
carried Lady Arabella off against her will.</p>

<p>The jury retired, and, the day having been
fatiguing, the lords justices determined to wait
in their retiring-room for an hour, where they
could be called, if the jury promptly reached a
verdict. This troubled me&mdash;this expectation
of a quick decision.</p>

<p>The judges having retired and suspended the
sitting of the court, we at once went over and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>sat with Giles, who maintained perfectly his
manly composure. He laughed with Sir Peter
over some of the events of the fight between the
<i>Ajax</i> and her two enemies, complimented Lady
Hawkshaw upon her triumph over the laws of
the land relating to evidence, and said many
kind things to Daphne.</p>

<p>While we were in the midst of a cheerful conversation,
and not observant of what was going
on in the other part of the hall, we suddenly
heard the crier proclaiming the entrance of their
lordships, and at the same moment Sir Thomas
Vernon entered by another door. Hanging on
his arm was Lady Arabella Stormont. And
then the jury filed in with solemn faces, and
what followed all seemed to me like some horrid
dream.</p>

<p>Although several persons were moving about,
there seemed to me a dreadful silence; and although
the candles burned, and a great hobgoblin
of a moon peered in at the windows, there
seemed an awful darkness. And after a time,
in which I was oppressed by this ghostly silence
and darkness, I saw the senior lord justice put
on a black cap, and sentence Giles Vernon to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>hanged by the neck until he was dead, that day
fortnight.</p>

<p>My eyes roved aimlessly around, and fell at
that moment on Lady Arabella Stormont. A
faint smile flickered on her lovely mouth.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="X">X</h2></div>

<p>In that hour of horror, I became weaker and
more helpless than the weakest and most helpless
woman. Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw
were too stunned to think. I remember, now,
the look of despair on Sir Peter’s countenance,
where I had never before seen anything but
sturdy courage,&mdash;and it was an added terror.
And the one who retained her senses, who suggested
a forlorn hope, was Daphne,&mdash;the
youngest, the least experienced of us all.</p>

<p>“To London!” she said. “To the king,
for pardon! I myself will go upon my knees to
him. He shall&mdash;he <i>shall</i> pardon Giles!”</p>

<p>We were all huddled together, then, in our
parlor at the inn, having just returned from
the assize hall.</p>

<p>“Richard and I will go,” said Sir Peter.</p>

<p>“And Daphne and I will stay and comfort
Giles,” spoke Lady Hawkshaw.</p>

<p>A week to London, and a week to return,
was easy traveling&mdash;but how long would it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>take us to reach the king? And what ministers
would be in town? And what would be
the earliest moment we could leave London?
All these things were in our minds to torment
us. Nevertheless, within half an hour, we were
on our way.</p>

<p>While we were demanding the best horses,
and having them put to, an insolent groom
came in the stable-yard, and asked for horses
for Sir Thomas Vernon and Lady Arabella
Stormont and Lady Arabella’s companion, Mrs.
Whitall, and two servants, for London. The
head hostler replied roughly that they had no
time to attend him then, as they were starting
Sir Peter Hawkshaw and Mr. Glyn off for London,
too, to beg Mr. Giles Vernon’s life. The
man, at this, grew saucy, and offered a handsome
bonus for the horses which were then being
put to for us. I caught him by the collar, and
threw him out of the stable-yard, where the
hostlers drubbed him soundly, thank God!</p>

<p>One hurried kiss to Daphne, a brief farewell
between Sir Peter and Lady Hawkshaw, and
we were off for London. Our race into Scotland
was nothing to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>The roads were much cut up, and although
we traveled day and night, we were more than
four days on the way. We reached London
early in the day; and, without stopping for
food, or to change our linen, we went to the
Admiralty. There we got the information that
the First Lord was visiting in the country, in
Kent. Within the hour, I was on my way
to Kent. When I reached the place, the First
Lord had left, not more than two hours before,
for London. I had passed him on the road,
without knowing him. I returned to London.
Sir Peter had seen several members of the
government, meanwhile, and had been privately
informed that the king was suffering mentally;
and although hopes were entertained that the
spell would pass away, without the necessity of
informing the country or Parliament, still, access
to him was refused to all by his physicians,
except the members of his family and immediate
household, and they were charged not to mention
business to him; it would be impossible to
approach him.</p>

<p>When Sir Peter told me this, I became so
weak I was forced to sit down. After a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>minutes of agony, a desperate resolve came to
me. I rose, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have a scheme&mdash;desperate, but not impossible.
Go with me to the Prince of Wales.
He is at Carlton House, but goes back and
forth to Windsor.”</p>

<p>Sir Peter jumped at this poor chance, and
we agreed to go immediately.</p>

<p>We had left York on a Friday, and had
reached London on the Monday. Two days
had been lost in the journey to Kent; and it was
now late in the evening of Wednesday. We
had, luckily, brought our uniforms along; and,
dressing ourselves in them,&mdash;Sir Peter with all
his orders sewn on his coat,&mdash;we called a hackney-coach,
and drove to Carlton House.</p>

<p>When we got there, it was about ten o’clock
in the evening. The windows were brilliantly
lighted up, and it was about the hour that the
Prince of Wales was known to be in his best
humor&mdash;but the hour when he most hated to
be disturbed.</p>

<p>We descended, and the sentries passed us
through, on account of our uniforms and Sir
Peter’s decorations on his breast. We reached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>the door, and knocked. The porter opened the
door gingerly, when Sir Peter, giving it a kick,
walked in, followed by me. The man attempted
to arrest our progress, but Sir Peter
said to him fiercely,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you think, you damned lackey, that
you can be insolent to an admiral in his Majesty’s
service?” The man apologized humbly
and ushered us into a large reception-room on
the first floor, saying he would call the gentleman
of the chambers.</p>

<p>We seated ourselves. Even in that time of
agony, I noticed the beauty of the room&mdash;indeed,
my senses seemed preternaturally acute,
and every incident of that dreadful time is deeply
fixed in my mind. The ceiling was of gilt,
while around the walls were paintings of Flora.
A gilt chandelier diffused light through the
apartment, and at one side was a pair of large
folding doors.</p>

<p>After a long wait, a gentleman, Mr. Digby,
appeared. He received us politely, but said it
was impossible to disturb the Prince then, as he
was just sitting down to piquet. Sir Peter remained
silent; he was used to giving orders, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>the words, “It is impossible to see His Royal
Highness,” were peculiarly disagreeable to him.</p>

<p>I then made my plea. I told Mr. Digby
that the life of a gallant officer and gentleman
was in jeopardy, and that we begged to see his
Royal Highness, in the hope that the king
might be approached.</p>

<p>“That, too, is impossible,” coldly replied Mr.
Digby. “The king is far from well.”</p>

<p>Just then, some one on the other side of the
folding doors opened one of them the least bit
in the world, and then closed it&mdash;but not before
we had seen streams of light pouring from
it, a long table brilliant with plate and ornaments,
and a company of about twenty gentlemen
sitting around it, and at one end sat a
personage whom we at once recognized as the
Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>Without a word, Sir Peter arose, and, darting
toward the door,&mdash;for he was ever an agile
man,&mdash;threw it open, and walked into the presence
of his Royal Highness.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, marching up to the Prince,
“I am Admiral Sir Peter Hawkshaw, and I
have boarded you, so to speak, sir, in order to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>save the life of one of the gallantest officers in
the service of his Majesty.”</p>

<p>I had always heard that his Royal Highness
was a gentleman, and I saw then such an exhibition
of readiness and good taste as I never
saw before, and never expect to see again.
Every one at the table, except the Prince,
seemed astounded at the sudden entrance and
startling address of a short active little man in
an admiral’s uniform. But the Prince offered
Sir Peter his hand in the coolest manner in the
world, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Most happy to meet you, Sir Peter. I
recollect well that you carried the <i>Indomptable</i>
by boarding very successfully. But how did
you get past the watch-dogs at the door, my
dear sir?”</p>

<p>“By carrying sail hard, your Royal Highness,”
responded Sir Peter, “and seeing this
door open, faith, said I, to myself, having risked
my skin these forty years for the king and his
successors, sure, I can risk it once more by walking
in on my Prince, and here I am, sir, ready
to state my case. That bloody popinjay, Digby”
(Digby was right behind him), “wanted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>me to let you alone because you were about to go
to piquet, but I think no prince of England
would sacrifice a man’s life to a game of
piquet.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not I, Sir Peter,” answered his
Royal Highness, rising, “and now I have an
hour entirely at your service.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Sir Peter, “I ask the honor of
shaking hands with you, not as a royal prince,
but as an honest man and good fellow.”</p>

<p>I think the Prince was ever susceptible to
honest praise, for he was no fool, and he was
undoubtedly pleased when Sir Peter wrung his
hand. He then led the way into another room,
and the door was closed.</p>

<p>The rest of the party behaved very civilly to
me, and I accepted thankfully an invitation to
have something to eat and drink. They were
merciful to me, seeing my distress of mind, and
did not plague me with questions, but resumed
their conversation with one another.</p>

<p>Presently the Prince and Sir Peter appeared,
and his Royal Highness said, with that charm
of manner which seduced some men and many
women,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“Hark’ee, Sir Peter; I do not promise that
the affair will be complete before Sunday night;
I go to Windsor early in the morning, and two
days is a brief time in which to arrange so important
a matter. But if you will be at Windsor
on Sunday morning, I pledge you my word
as a gentleman the paper shall be ready, signed,
sealed, and delivered.”</p>

<p>At that Sir Peter fairly broke down, and
could only say, “God bless you, sir, God bless
you!” and the Prince, turning the old man’s
emotion off gently, smiled and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“’Tis for the preservation of the gallantry
of our sex, Sir Peter, that this young officer
must not hang.”</p>

<p>He warmly invited us to remain and finish up
the wine, and then one of the gentlemen at the
table, whether of design or not, mentioned the
extraordinary reports which had just reached
London concerning the trial at York, and I, encouraged
thereto by a subtle look and a question
of his Royal Highness, told the whole story,
assisted by Sir Peter. It was listened to with
the deepest interest.</p>

<p>Lady Arabella Stormont was known to every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>person there, and the Prince remarked that he
had danced with her at the last birthnight ball.
Her infatuation for Overton was well known
and freely commented on, and the strange measures
that women will sometimes venture upon in
the interest, as they think, of the man they love,
was exemplified in her testifying against Giles
Vernon. Sir Thomas Vernon’s hatred of his heir
was also well known,&mdash;and as the web was unfolded
to the Prince he listened with an air of
the profoundest thought, and his comment was
significant,&mdash;</p>

<p>“The king can pardon.”</p>

<p>He had pity on us and did not press us to
remain to cards, so we left Carlton House about
an hour after entering it, and with hearts immeasurably
lighter. Our first thought was to
hasten back to our lodgings to send off our
good news to Lady Hawkshaw and Daphne by
the northern mail.</p>

<p>Sir Peter told me then that the Prince had
directed him to go to Windsor in the morning
and remain, and that he himself would bring
him back on the Sunday morning, if the counter
signatures to his Majesty’s could not be had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>before. The Prince was quite familiar with the
procedure, and engaged to get the pardon from
the king without difficulty.</p>

<p>Early next morning Sir Peter left me. It
was agreed that I should proceed on the Sunday
morning to the Bear and Churn, a tavern and
posting station near London, on the northern
road, to arrange in advance for the best cattle,
in order that not a moment might be lost in returning
to York. So, after two miserable days
alone in London, while Sir Peter was at Windsor,
I was glad on Sunday morning to be on the
northern road, preparing for our rapid return
to York. The Bear and Churn was directly on
the highway, and was well out of London, being
surrounded by green fields and orchards.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning, more like April
than February. The greenness of the earth,
the blueness of the heavens, the quiet of the
country, after the rattle and roar and dun skies
of London, were balm to my soul.</p>

<p>I reached the inn by ten o’clock; and, having
arranged for their best horses, and sent word
two stations ahead, I sat down to pass the day
as best I might. I wrote a long letter to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>Daphne, and then, it being about twelve o’clock,
I went out for a walk.</p>

<p>There was a pretty pathway, through a little
grove, toward a rolling field, next the highway.
I took this path, and presently came face to
face, at a turn in the path, with Overton. He
was singularly dressed for a man of his quality
and profession.</p>

<p>He wore black clothes, with plain silver
buckles at the knees, and black silk stockings
and shoes. His hair, unpowdered, was tied with
a black ribbon; but he wore no crape or vestige
of mourning. I had ever thought him the
handsomest man in England; but in this garb,
so different from the brilliant uniform or other
exquisite dress in which I had heretofore seen
him, he looked like an Apollo. He greeted me
gravely, but not impolitely; and we walked
along together. He had heard of my marriage,
and felicitated me on it.</p>

<p>My heart was so full of Giles Vernon that I
burst out with the story. It seemed quite new
to him; and he listened to it with breathless
attention, occasionally ejaculating his horror at
the conduct of Sir Thomas Vernon and of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>Lady Arabella Stormont. It gave me a savage
pleasure to tell him every dreadful particular
concerning Arabella; and by the look of consciousness
which came into his expressive face,
and by the way in which he avoided my eye, I
saw that he knew he was a factor in the case
against his will. At last, quite transported by
my rage against these two, I cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>“And it is for the purpose of securing the
estate to you that Arabella Stormont thus swore
away the life of Giles Vernon; but God will
confound her and Sir Thomas Vernon yet!”</p>

<p>“Truly,” said he, in a thrilling voice, “God
will confound all the wicked. He will bring
this horrid scheme to naught in every way; for
know you, if Lady Arabella Stormont were to
throw herself on her knees before me&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped, and colored violently; he had
not meant to admit what the whole world knew,&mdash;that
Arabella Stormont had adored him for
seven years past. He hurriedly changed the
subject, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Perhaps you do not know that I am no
longer in the army.”</p>

<p>I said I did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“Although I have recovered the use of my
limbs, and look to be in health, I am not fit for
service; and I was retired on half-pay only a
few days ago. My life is not likely to be long;
but released as I am, by God’s hand, from the
profession of arms, I shall devote the remnant
of my life to the service of the Lord God
Almighty. His message came to me years ago,
but I was deaf to it. I was in love with the
world, and possessed by the flesh and the devil.
I committed murders under the name of war.
I dishonored my Maker by my dissipations. I
spent in gambling and vice the money wrung
from the poor that were bond-slaves to labor
and poverty. I blasphemed, and yet I was not
counted evil by the world.”</p>

<p>I listened and wondered to myself, should this
be true, where stood we all?</p>

<p>Overton’s face had flushed, his eyes were full
of rapture; he seemed to dwell in the glory of
the Lord.</p>

<p>“But now I am free from the body of that
death, and subject only to the yoke of the
Nazarene,&mdash;the Jesus who labored with His
hands to show that work was honorable; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>Carpenter who called about Him those as poor
as Himself, and preached to them the love of
God and one’s neighbor; who received the Magdalen
as a sister and the leper as a brother.”</p>

<p>I was silent. I had heard many sermons
from deans and dignitaries,&mdash;all well-fed men,
and every man jack of them after promotion
from the Whigs,&mdash;and these sermons had left
my heart as untouched as that of the wild
Indian of North America. But this was different.
After a while, Overton continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>“As this Jesus called all manner of men to
follow Him,&mdash;the greedy tax-gatherer, as well
as Peter the poor fisherman, and John the gentle
and studious youth,&mdash;so He called me; and,
like the tax-gatherer, whose stony heart was
melted by the voice of Jesus, I say with tears,
‘My God! I follow Thee!’”</p>

<p>We had now approached the corner of the
field, and involuntarily stopped. I said to him
blunderingly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Shall you take orders?”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied. “I do not aspire to open
my mouth as a teacher&mdash;I am not worthy;
but a few of the humblest people about here&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
have been in this place for some time&mdash;come
to me on Sundays, in the forenoon, to
ask me to speak to them. They are day-laborers,
hostlers&mdash;the kind of people I once
fancied to be without souls. I speak to them,
not as a preacher and teacher, but as a brother
and a friend. It is now time for them to
assemble.”</p>

<p>I saw, sure enough, a number of poorly-dressed
rustics coming toward the field. They
came by twos and threes, the women mostly
with children in arms, or hanging to their
skirts. When all had arrived, there were
about thirty men and women. They seated
themselves on the grass, and I along with
them, and, in some mysterious way, I felt, for
the first time in my life, that the plowman was
my brother, and the kitchen wench my sister.</p>

<p>When they were all seated, Overton took
from his pocket a small Bible, and read the
Sermon on the Mount. The people listened
reverently. He gave them a short discourse,
suited to their understanding, and then read
to them a simple hymn, which they sang with
fervor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>I listened with a strange feeling, half pain,
half pleasure, half satisfaction, half dissatisfaction.
I wished for Daphne’s sweet spirit to
be near me. It came to my mind how like
was this meeting of the poor and unlearned
to those held by the Carpenter of Nazareth on
the shores of the Sea of Galilee. The hymn
echoed sweetly over the green fields; it was a
part of that great antiphon with which Nature
replies to the harmonics of the Most High.
The quiet scene, the woods, the fields, the kine
in the pasture near by, all seemed one in this act
of worship. But presently my soul was distracted
by what I saw on the highway close by
us. A handsome traveling chariot, followed by
a plain post-chaise going Londonward, stopped.
Out of the chariot stepped Lady Arabella
Stormont, and, through an opening in the
hedge, she entered the field. After a considerable
interval, Mrs. Whitall followed her; and,
after a still longer one, Sir Thomas Vernon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo10"><img src="images/i_224.jpg" width="400" alt="Will you speak to me?" /></a></div>

<p class="caption no-indent">“Will you speak to me?” <i>Page <a href="#Page_225">225</a></i></p>

<p>Lady Arabella walked noiselessly over the
grass, and, when she reached the edge of the
group, stopped. Her eyes were full of laughing
contempt at first, but, when Overton turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>his glance full upon her, she suddenly assumed
a look of seriousness, and folded her hands as
if in silent prayer. Behind her, Mrs. Whitall’s
foolish face was all fear, while Sir Thomas
Vernon grinned unpleasantly over her shoulder.
Overton, without taking the slightest notice of
them, at the conclusion of the hymn announced
that he would make a prayer, and asked his
hearers to join with him in a petition that the
life might be spared of a certain young man,
Giles Vernon, now under sentence of death in
York jail. We all stood up, then, the men
removing their hats. I held mine before my
face to conceal my tears, while Overton made
a brief but earnest prayer for Giles, and I
could not refrain from crying, “Amen! Amen!”
when he concluded.</p>

<p>The people then trooped off, and we, the
gentlefolks, were left together.</p>

<p>Overton surveyed Lady Arabella and Sir
Thomas with much contempt. Lady Arabella
was the first to speak. She held up her head
timidly, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Will you not speak to me?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Overton sternly. “Giles Vernon’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
life may be spared; but upon you is
blood-guiltiness.”</p>

<p>Arabella turned pale, and replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I was summoned as a witness. I was
obliged to testify.”</p>

<p>Overton said nothing. Then Sir Thomas,
taking snuff with his usual grace, remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I listened with attention to one lawbreaker
praying for another lawbreaker. Of course,
you know, this meeting of yours is seditious&mdash;and
many a man has been stood in the pillory
for it.”</p>

<p>“And one Man,” replied Overton, “Jesus
Christ, was crucified for it.”</p>

<p>He turned, and with me, took the path back
to the tavern. I heard, as we went on, an
altercation behind me, and involuntarily, after
we had gone some distance, I looked back.
Lady Arabella was struggling in the grasp of
Sir Thomas Vernon, while Mrs. Whitall looked
on, and wrung her hands. Sir Thomas, however,
was no match for Arabella’s young
strength. She broke away from him, and, running
after us, caught up, panting and breathless,
with us, as we entered the little grove.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>And then I saw an almost exact representation
of the scene when Giles Vernon had insanely
and with unmanly groveling and violence
pleaded with Arabella for her love,&mdash;so she
pleaded with Philip Overton. She held him by
the arms, when he would have thrown her off.</p>

<p>“Philip! Philip!” she cried. “I did it for
you! I determined to make you rich, great,
even if you refused my fortune. Sir Thomas
can not live long. Surely, <i>you</i> can not reproach
me, if all the world does. The stupid,
stupid world thinks I did it under the influence
of Sir Thomas Vernon; but no, it was not hate
for Giles Vernon, it was my love for you, Philip
Overton, that made me appear at the York
Assizes.”</p>

<p>“Remember yourself,” said Overton to her
sternly. “Others, besides myself, see your
degradation!”</p>

<p>“It is no degradation to love truly, to love
as I do. Speak but one word to me, and I will
become a Methodist like yourself. I, too, will
go among the poor, and serve and love them;
and I will even love God for your sake!”</p>

<p>The awful grotesqueness of this, the blasphemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
of it, was altogether unknown to her.
She continued wildly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Does not my soul need saving as much as
those clods you have been praying with?”</p>

<p>“You blaspheme!” replied Overton, casting
her off.</p>

<p>And, to make the resemblance between her
own unwomanly conduct and the unmanly conduct
of Giles Vernon the more singular, she
recovered herself, as he had done, in a single
moment of time. She laid her hand on Overton’s
arm, and looked keenly into his eyes.
Her glance seemed to enchain him, and to set
her free. She breathed a long sigh, and, turning,
gazed about her, like a person awaking
from a nightmare. Then, with perfect self-possession,
she dropped a curtsey to us both,
and said, in her natural, playful manner,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. Overton, I see I have been mistaken.
I should have tried to cheat the law by not
appearing when I was summoned; or, I should
have testified falsely. And for my indiscreet
conduct just now, let me tell you, for seven
years I have been under a spell. It is now
broken for ever. Titania once loved Bottom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>the weaver; but not always. I bid you good
day, Captain Philip Overton, and you, Mr.
Richard Glyn. And I trust Giles Vernon’s life
may be saved, if only to keep you, Captain
Overton, as poor as you deserve to be. For
myself, I shall shortly marry,&mdash;perhaps, Sir
Thomas Vernon,&mdash;then, neither of you will get
the estates. Good morning!”</p>

<p>And she was gone, flying along the field,
with a white mantle streaming after her, and
her flight as rapid as the swallows in spring.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XI">XI</h2></div>

<p>At twelve o’clock that night Sir Peter arrived
at the tavern, and with the pardon.</p>

<p>The expectation of his coming, and the
greater matter upon which we were engaged,
prevented my mind from dwelling longer upon
the strange scene I had witnessed between Overton
and Lady Arabella. Overton did not speak
her name to me, and showed much sympathy
for us. When Sir Peter’s chaise drove up to
the door of the Bear and Churn, another chaise
with four horses was waiting, and into it we
huddled, bidding Overton a hurried farewell;
and in another moment we were off for York,
the horses doing their best.</p>

<p>Sir Peter then told me the circumstances of
his visit to Windsor. The Prince, who was
always most powerful when the king was on
the verge of madness, saw his father and found
him comparatively rational. The story being
broached to him, he appeared interested, and
even grew more collected as his attention was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>chained. He recalled at once Sir Peter Hawkshaw
and the capture of the <i>Indomptable</i> and
<i>Xantippe</i>, and corrected the Prince when he
spoke of Sir Peter as Vice-Admiral of the
White. It was a very easy matter to get his
signature to the pardon, and the necessary seals
and formalities took some little time but no
trouble, and when Sir Peter presented himself
at the Castle on Sunday, all was prepared for
him.</p>

<p>We felt now comparatively safe. There was
little doubt that we could reach York at least
twenty-four hours in advance of the date set
for the execution; our letters would precede
us, giving positive assurances of hope; and we
looked for no accidents, having a new and
strong chaise.</p>

<p>After Sir Peter had told me his story, I told
him mine about Lady Arabella and Overton.
He was not much imbued with the kind of
religion that Overton preached, although he
swore roundly by Church and State, and was
always a great churchman when he was slightly
in liquor, which did not happen often. He
therefore condemned Overton’s sermon, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>I tried to repeat to him, as a damned, beastly
low sort of religion, unfit for a gentleman to
practise; but he admitted that Overton lacked
neither brains nor courage. For Lady Arabella,
though, he had the stern disapproval of
an honest heart, and in his excitement swore
both long and loud because of the short-sightedness
of Providence in permitting such women to
exist for the undoing of his Majesty’s officers
of both services.</p>

<p>We made good progress that night and the
next day, which was Monday, and began to
have strong hopes of reaching York Wednesday
night. But on Monday, in the afternoon, the
weather suddenly changed, a violent snow-storm
set in, and our postboys wilfully, I think, drove
us ten miles out of the way, near a tavern
where they hoped, no doubt, we would agree
to stop until the storm should be over. But
Sir Peter, putting one of his great horse-pistols
to the postboy’s head, forced him to turn back
to the high-road. We lost three hours by this;
and when we got to our next posting stage,
our horses, engaged two days ahead, had been
taken. We got others, after a frantic effort,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>but at the end of that day’s journey we saw our
margin of time diminished exactly one-half.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to describe the fierce and
gnawing impatience which consumed us, nor the
awful and unspoken dread which began to overshadow
us. Sir Peter was a man of stout heart,
and had no more notion of giving up at this
stage of the affair than he dreamed of surrendering
when he saw the <i>Indomptable</i> to windward
and the <i>Xantippe</i> to leeward.</p>

<p>The weather, however, grew worse instead of
better, and even four horses could scarcely drag
us through the mire made by the snow and rain.
In spite of all we could do our progress diminished,
although at no time did it seem hopeless,
until&mdash;O God! twenty miles from York, at
midnight on the Thursday, Sir Peter himself
suddenly gave out; the strain had proved too
much for his brave heart and sturdy frame. It
came as the horses were wallowing along the
road in the darkness, and I, holding my watch
in my hand, was glancing at it every ten
minutes, by the feeble light of the traveling
lamp. I spoke to Sir Peter as he lay back in
the chaise wrapped in his boat-cloak, and got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>no answer. He was unconscious. Without
stopping the chaise, I got some brandy,
which I tried to pour down his throat, but could
not. I grew much alarmed,&mdash;it was not like
Sir Peter to refuse good brandy, and as we
were passing a farmstead, I stopped the chaise,
knocked the people up, and had Sir Peter
carried into the house. I met with kindness,
and I repaid it with coin of the realm. Sir
Peter soon revived, and his first words were,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Push on, my lad. Don’t wait to repair
damages.”</p>

<p>I found that his seizure was really trifling,
and he assured me he would be able to resume
the journey by daylight, the farmer agreeing to
furnish him horses; so, in half an hour I had
again taken the road.</p>

<p>And ten miles from York, the chaise broke
down!</p>

<p>I had the horses taken out, and, mounting
the best beast, made for York at the top of his
speed, which was poor,&mdash;the creature was
already spent with traveling.</p>

<p>It was just daylight, and streaks of golden
glory were lighting up the pallid dawn; I urged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>the poor beast onward. Seven miles he went,
then he dropped dead, just as the sun was
gilding the spires of York Cathedral. Before
me, along the road, jogged an itinerant tinker
on a rather good-looking horse, the tools of a
tinker’s trade hanging from a moth-eaten
saddle. I was young and strong,&mdash;he was
middle-aged and ill-fed and feeble. I ran up
to him, holding five guineas in my hand.</p>

<p>“Lend me this horse to ride to York!” I
cried.</p>

<p>The man, astonished at my abrupt address,
stopped, but gave me no answer. I made my
own answer, though, by dragging him off the
beast, dashing the five guineas on the ground,
and clattering off, throwing away the tools and
kettles as I galloped along.</p>

<p>Already there were great crowds in the
streets, and as I made my way madly toward
the jail, I was often impeded. I shrieked, I
screamed at the people, and waved aloft my
precious paper, shouting, “Pardon! Pardon!”
The cry was taken up, and swelled in a great
roar that came from a thousand friendly
throats. As I galloped along on the tinker’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>horse, in a frenzy, through the crowded streets,
an awful unspeakable Thing loomed up before
me. It was the gibbet, and it was empty!</p>

<p>I felt the hot tears run down my cheeks at
this, and some recollection of the God that
Overton had preached to me caused me to utter
an inarticulate thanksgiving! But if my
tongue faltered, my heart did not.</p>

<p>At last I pushed my way through shouting
crowds, to the jail. The people parted, and I
saw a black cart drawn by a white horse, and
Giles Vernon, with pinioned hands, sitting in it,
by the side of the hangman. I noticed&mdash;as I
did all the trifles of that dreadful time&mdash;that
the jailer was ashy pale, and Giles was fresh-colored.
I flung myself off my horse, rushed
toward the cart, holding the paper above my
head. Oh, the roaring and the shouting! I
thrust it in Giles’ face; the hangman, in a
second, cut the thongs that bound the prisoner’s
hands. Giles took the pardon and kissed it,
and then threw his arms around me and kissed
me, and smiled and waved his hat in the air,
while voices thundered, men shouting like
demons, and women screaming and weeping.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>And the next thing I knew Daphne appeared,
as if dropped down from Heaven, and, springing
into the cart, clasped Giles; and Lady
Hawkshaw, a little slower, but yet quick, descended
from the coach, in which she and
Daphne had come, and embraced all of us; and
then, the cheering seemed to rend the skies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption no-indent">I saw Giles Vernon with pinioned hands. <i>Page <a href="#Page_236">236</a></i></p>

<p>In a little while, the mood of the crowd
changed. They began to clamor for the blood
of Sir Thomas Vernon. He was known to be
away from home, but, as if by a preconcerted
movement, a dash was made for Vernon Court,
which was but five miles away. The military
were called out, and the crowd stopped; but not
without a collision, and several persons were
badly injured, which did not tend toward better
feeling for Sir Thomas.</p>

<p>For ourselves, I remained with Giles until he
was duly released by the officers of the law,
while Daphne and Lady Hawkshaw set off to
meet Sir Peter on the road. They met him, five
miles off, and brought him back to York in
their coach. I shall never forget the scene
when they drove up to the inn where Giles and I
were already, the crowd, however, not allowing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>him to remain indoors at all. When the coach
hove to, the people, in their delight, picked Sir
Peter up and carried him bodily up stairs, to an
open balcony, and demanded a speech, followed
by “Parliament! Parliament! Our next member!”
and so on. Sir Peter made a speech,&mdash;the
most wonderful I ever heard,&mdash;standing
with one hand on Giles’ shoulder, and the other
on mine, with Lady Hawkshaw and Daphne in
the background.</p>

<p>He began by roundly damning Sir Thomas
Vernon, “and a lady who shall be nameless.”
Nevertheless, in spite of some vagaries, the
speech was full of sound sense, and he promised
the people, if they gave him their suffrages for
parliament, he would do all in his power for the
abolition of the barbarous law from which Giles
Vernon had suffered so cruelly. He averred
that it was impossible for a seaman, alone and
unaided, to take care of himself on dry land,
Jack ashore being a helpless creature at best,
and but for Lady Hawkshaw he would probably
have been hanged himself, long ago. This
allusion to Lady Hawkshaw, who fairly divided
the honors with Giles, brought forth yells of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>delight from the crowd. Her ladyship appeared
and bowed magnificently, and it was a
regular triumph for us all, from beginning to
end.</p>

<p>Next day, with Giles, we all started for London,
the happiest coach-load of people in the
three kingdoms.</p>

<p>Two days after our arrival, we read the announcement
of the marriage, at St. George’s,
Hanover Square, of Sir Thomas Vernon to Lady
Arabella Stormont.</p>

<p>Sir Peter was delighted at this match, and so
was Lady Hawkshaw, and for once they were
agreed. The position of the newly-married
couple in London was anything but a pleasant
one; for Giles became the object of public sympathy,
and of popular and royal approval. The
Prince of Wales sent for him, and our visit to
Windsor, whither we all went to thank the
king, was made a triumph for us. Sir Thomas
and Lady Vernon were forbidden the court and
Carlton House, and were frequently hissed in
public. I saw them myself at Drury Lane,
when they were hissed. Sir Thomas merely
grinned, while Lady Arabella surveyed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>scowling faces before her with a slow sweet
smile, and calmly played with the diamonds in
her stomacher.</p>

<p>We had a whole year of happiness. The
dreadful experience Giles had been through
began to tell on him, and he was permitted to
remain quietly a year on shore. And I, because
of Giles, was given a year with my bride before
I had to leave her. And what a year of blessedness
it was to all! We all lived with Sir Peter
and Lady Hawkshaw in Berkeley Square, and
those two honest souls took delight in us. Lady
Hawkshaw became a heroine, and the worthy
woman enjoyed it thoroughly. Overton came
sometimes to see us. A persecution had been
set on foot against him; and he was several
times arrested and sentenced for unlawful assemblage.
But persecution was not the way to
prevail with Overton.</p>

<p>It was very well understood who instigated
these continued prosecutions, and that did not
help to increase the popularity of Sir Thomas
and his beautiful wife. At last, a year to the
month after the trial at York, the last indignity
was offered to Overton. He was sentenced to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>be whipped at the cart’s-tail, and set in the pillory.</p>

<p>There was a general rally of his friends; and
on the winter morning when this barbarous sentence
was to be carried out, a number, including
many persons of note, were assembled at the
prison, when Sir Peter and I joined them.</p>

<p>We soon heard that the government would
not permit the first part of the sentence to be
carried out; but when Overton emerged from
the prison, he was unaware of this, and prepared
for the worst. The holy calmness of his countenance
and air brought even Sir Peter to admit
that “the pious dog is a man, after all.”
When informed that he would not be whipped,
Overton only remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>“My Master was scourged. Why should I
rebel?”</p>

<p>Arrived at the place of punishment, we found
a great crowd assembled, of all sorts of persons,
among them some of the highest quality.
Overton saluted them, and with the utmost
dignity submitted to the cruel and hateful punishment.
He had, however, the undisguised
sympathy of the officers of the law, as well as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>of the crowd, and was treated with the utmost
tenderness.</p>

<p>He was to spend three hours pilloried, and
it was made the greatest triumph of his life.</p>

<p>It is possible for a good man undergoing
unjust punishment to be dignified, even in the
pillory; and so it was with Overton. His singular
beauty, the mildness of his countenance,
the uncomplaining fortitude with which he
submitted to an odious and miserable position,
the remembrance of his past military services,
showed him to be every inch a man. Many of
his friends came in their coaches, and, descending
and going up to Overton, saluted him
respectfully and expressed their sympathy, to
which Overton gently returned thanks. At last
a very splendid coach appeared. It was magnificently
horsed with four thoroughbreds, and
had outriders, besides two huge footmen with
nosegays. It drew up in front of the pillory,
and within it sat Lady Vernon, superbly
dressed; and in her arms she held a very young
infant in a great robe of lace and satin. Two
nurses sat on the front seat; and Sir Thomas’
saturnine countenance glared behind Lady Vernon’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
beautiful, triumphant face. The coach
stopped; and Lady Vernon, holding the child
up in her arms, directly in front of Overton’s
eyes, gave him a smile and a meaning look, as
much as to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Poor wretch! your inheritance is gone!”
The crowd, which was never in a good humor
with the Vernons, began to hiss vigorously.
This they appeared not to mind; but when
hisses were followed by a shower of stones and
sticks, the equipage rolled off at the top of its
speed.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock Overton was released, and
at once he was exhorting the people to fear God
and live truly to Him. He was not interrupted
by the constables who were present, and was
listened to with solemn attention. He has
preached ever since, and has never again been
molested. And when a dear little girl came to
my Daphne,&mdash;I was then at sea, fighting the
French,&mdash;Overton was at the christening, and
made a prayer over her infant head, which my
Daphne believes will keep that dear child good
and holy all her life.</p>

<p>Giles Vernon, now Captain Vernon, in command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
of his Majesty’s ship <i>Acasta</i>, forty-four,
is counted the smartest of the young captains
in the British service. The women still love
him; but Giles has grown a little shy of going
too far with them, and swears he will die a
bachelor. However, there appears to be an
affair forward between my little Daphne, who is
now four years and six months old, and Captain
Vernon, and I think something will come of it
when she is of a marriageable age&mdash;and so
thinks her mother too.</p>

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
